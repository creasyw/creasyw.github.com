  <div class="entry-content"><p>The LTE-Advanced introduced by LTE standard release 10 has many new features, including the carrier aggregation, enhanced intercell interferernce coordination (ICIC) for heterogeneous networks (HetNets), enhanced multiple-antenna transmission supporting up to eight downlink layers, and relaying and coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission.</p>

<p>For the carrier aggregation, in order to fully compliant with the IMT-Advanced requirements, the radio-access technology in LTE-Advanced does not only provide entensive support for deployment in spectrum allocations with bandwides ranging from 1 MHz to 20 MHz for backwards compatibility, but also extends by means of carrier aggregation, where multiple component carriers are aggregated and jointly used for transmission to/from a signle terminal. Up to five component carriers, possibly each of different bandwidth, can be aggregated, allowing for transmission bandwidth up to 100 MHz. The component carriers that a UE needs to support are determined through a UE-specific configuration process and a dynamic activation and deactivation process. Due to this activation/deactivation process, the state of SCells can be changed frequently. As a result, <strong>radio link monitoring is only supported in the PCell but not in SCells to avoid complex UE behavior and additional control signaling overhead. Despite this kind of effort, the increased complexity due to physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) decoding and timing tracking of multiple component carriers cannot be avoided</strong>. </p>

<p>The receiver RF filter design depends on the type of carrier aggregation. For the interest of low hardware complexity, a singular RF chain is preferable. But it requires an analog-to-digital converter and RF filter with larger bandwidth. Moreover, due to activation and deactivation of component carriers, there is a retuning issue when a single RF is used for these component carriers. <strong>There should be techniques balancing the packet loss due to RF retuning and the measurement of deactivated SCells to achieve optimal network performance</strong>.</p>

<p>A HetNet consists of low-power picocells and femtocells in addition to high-power macrocells to improve end-users QoS. But this benefit comes at the cost of additional intercell interference between heterogeneous cells, and some of the femtocells might be closed subscriber group, which make the strongest downlink power at the viewpoint of certain UE be the interference. Besides, the commeon reference signal (CRS), synchronization signals, and physical broadcast channel (PBCH) are transmitted in almost blank subframe (ABS), which cause the collision among different Scells. **The interference cancellation should developed based on the release 8/9 which soly considers the macrocell interference management through ABS.</p>

<p>The LTE-Advanced system should fulfill the ITU requirements of the downlink peak spectral efficiency of 30 b/s/Hz. The peak spectral efficiency is the highest achievable data rate per overall cell bandwidth assuming error-free conditions when all available radio resources for the corresponding link direction are assigned to a single UE unit. While two- or four-layer transmission would be more prevalent even for the LTE-Advanced system, the required downlink peak spectral efficiency can only be attained using high-order antenna configurations (i.e., 8 × 8). <strong>The main challenge of high-order multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is computational complexity</strong>. Maximum likelihood (ML) detection is optimal in the sense that it minimizes error probability when the distributions of all data are equally likely. However, due to its high complexity in 8×8 MIMO systems with high modulation order, a direct implementation of ML detection might not be a viable option for such MIMO systems.</p>

<p>The alternatives are zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) detection, but both of them are much worse in performance compared with ML. The k-best detection is another choice, but although its performance is close to ML, its computational complexity is still high to be implemented in the real-world multi-antennas configurations.</p>

<p>In the UE, channel estimation is for feeding back channel state information (CSI) to the base station and equalization of the downlink channel in the process of data demodulation. One of the requirements for LTE-Advanced is that it should support up to eight-layer transmission, which implies that there need to be at least eight transmit antenna ports. Toward this, a key change in the reference signal design philosophy from LTE Release 8 is the separation of the demodulation reference signals (DM-RS) from the channel state information reference signals (CSI-RS) in Release 10. The up-side is saving significant reference signal overhead since it allows the densely populated DM-RS to be UE-specific. The down-side is that in order to provide for eight CSI-RS patterns, the density of CSI-RS in LTE-Advanced is significantly less than that of CRS, that is, there is only one CSI-RS resource element (RE) per RB per antenna port. Besides, CSI-RS is expected to be transmitted only once every five or ten sub-frames. <strong>Advanced algorithms are needed for CSI-RS-based channel estimation and computation of the CSI feedback parameters such as CQI (i.e., modulation and coding rate) because existing methods may incur throughput degradation and/or result in a failure to meet the target BLER requirements.</strong> Possible strategies to improve the CSI-RS channel estimation performance could include exploitation of the time-frequency correlations, the channel’s power delay profile (PDP) and the Doppler shift. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The question comes from the online course <em>Algorithm Design and Analysis (Part II)</em> in coursera. It is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem#All-pairs_shortest_paths">all-pairs shortest path problem</a>. As mentioned in the wikipedia, a more straightforward solution with Floyd–Warshall algorithm takes \(O(N^3)\) complexity, and the more computational efficient approach is to use a combination of Dijkstra’s algorithm, Bellman-Ford algorithm, and Johnson’s algorithm, which chould decrease the complexity to \(O(N^2logN)\). I implement the latter one for more interesting and challenging. There are several obstacles make the implementation a little bit trickier than I thought.</p>

<p>I have tried two or three different versions of Dijkstra’s algorithm while solving other math puzzles, and this time I use the built-in heapq function in Python. Keeping the “about-to explore” nodes in order and extracting the smallest/largest cost one in every iteration are the essense of this algorithm. But the cost to every node has to be updated when a node moves from “about-to explore” to “fully explored” category. At first, I just remove the original value and push the updated one into the heap. Because the heapq has no updated or remove methods, I can only use the remove mehtod of the list. This works fine for small amount of nodes (200) but the heap cannot keep right struture when the data becomes just a little bigger (500). Then I have to <em>heapify</em> it every time I update a “about-to explore” node.</p>

<p>The Bellman-Ford algorithm is more expensive compared with Dijkstra’s algirhtm if the graph is densily connected, but it deals with negative edge cost. This is also the one that helps me fully appreciate the dynamic programming.The implementation is intuitive and straightforward. For every vertex, the brutal force search performs to find the current optimal solution based on the previous knowledge. The optimization for space complexity is to only store the most recent result–keep an 2*N array and use a pointer filp-flop in every iteration is more effecient than keeping two 1*N array, discarding the older one and reclaiming a new one in every iteration. Aother optimization I make is to store the “about-to explore” nodes in a bucket, just as what Dijkstra’s does, which eliminates plenty of unnecessary calculation. But its tricky aspect is that because this algorithm is computing “distributed”, different from the “centralized” spanning of Dijkstra’s, if several “exploring” vertices point to a same “about-to explore” vertex, only the optimal cost should be kept.</p>

<p>Finally, the two algorithms above are connected by the Johnson’s algorithm. Dijkstra’s algorithm cannot deal with negative edge costs, but much more fast than Bellman-Ford especially in the case of “all-pairs”. Furthermore, the negative costs cannot be got rid of by adding uniformly for every edge. Johnson’s algorithm neatly solves it by adding pseudo-node to find weights of vertices and changing values of edges concerning their connected vertices. There is no hidden obstacle in the implementation. Only the special care should be taken for manipulating the nodes. It reminds me coding in C…</p>

<p>The overall algorithm solves the question and runs kind of standard. Still, I do not satisfy with the update procedure of heap. I will write a new version of this data structure in the near future and see if it can provide significant boost for the performance.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I heard lots of opinions from both Mac lovers and haters before I bought my macbook pro. It made me struggle for a while to leverage the pros and cons. But it finally turned out neither of them was completely right. I love my mbp very much, but the reason is not the good looking, but the flexibility interacting with unix programs and great ease using homebrew for almost all dependent packages. Besides, if I was not forced using Windows OS again in my internship, I would not notice how ugly and inconvenient it is.</p>

<p>The same process happened once again when I met latex. The final result was that I fell in love with it, and found out no one gave me a comprehensive description about it before.</p>

<p>LaTeX is more about higher-level accessing Tex for formating and typesetting. That is it. The focus for writing, the ease of math formulas, and even the licensing advantage over MS are all derivatives from others personal experiences. Actually, the basic intention gives it the most attractive feature. First of all, setting up a general framework, then maybe another subset of framework. The framework is at will, but everything fell into it must follow the specific rules. Then, beyond the framework, or within the framework, everything is also at will. One can freely design all specifications, and if needed, one can also overwrite the general rules set by the framework. On the one hand, the environment setting let author get rid of all trivial concerns. On the other hand, in every place, one can regain the control of everything. LaTeX is not only for writing, it is for programming.</p>

<p>Then, several days ago, I was trying to transfer my blog from Blogger to Jekyll. It is a static site generator that takes Markdown blog posts and onverts them into html files. The benefits are attractive: the website can be hosted by almost any server; the whole blog can easily be version controlled, since no php or MySQL needed, it requires less maintainance. During playing with it, I have the same kind of feeling again. I might easily mess everything up while on the other hand I have fully control of every element in the page.</p>

<p>I cannot build it without kind-hearted help from others. Especially,</p>

<p>Of course, there are some other things that I tried and failed to like. C++ might be an example… =P Anyway, my point is, regardless what other people say, you will never know what a thing really is unless you actually do it. There is one ultimate goal for a given project, and at least one suitable path to get there. Just do it. Then in retrospect, we will know if it is a better option, and will perform better the next time.</p>

  Aug. 10th. Complete the 1st chapter of sicp.<br/><br/>
  
  I really appreciate the exercises within each subsections, because I can feel that they are well designed. I used to have the same feeling when I did the homework from Dan&#8217;s course of programming languages. The exercises make the general concepts concrete and doable.
  <br/><br/>
  The abstraction is far from merely making the code more structured and readable. It is a design choice. Sometimes, it takes experience to find out where should be abstracted. And sometimes, it takes much more endeavors than simply mix everything together. But once the choice of abstraction is right, the program becomes clearer, and it increases many degrees of freedom for the design afterwards.</div>

&nbsp;<br />At the end of the 1st chapter, it enumerates the basic reason for the powerful lisp: first-order procedure.<br /><br />The major &#8220;privileges&#8221; of the first-order elements are:<br />1) They may be named by variables.<br />2) They may be passed as arguments to procedures.<br />3) They may be returned as the results of procedures.<br />4) They may be included in data structures.<br />They can be crucial abstraction mechanism permitting to express the general methods of computing as explicit elements in programming language, so that they can be handled just like other computational elements. The expression power is enormous.<br /><br />I have already been used to use the first two kinds of procedures, but the last two actually make the program even more expressive and powerful. Those are also the attractive properties sharing among functional programming languages.</div>

<br />While I am reading, I always try to distinguish which part of thoughts I used to learn from here when I read it for the first time, and which part I learned from Dan&#8217;s course. And, surprisingly enough, I learned almost all basic factors from Dan, though I always felt I learned a lot of things last year when I began to read it.<br /><br />The name of this book is perfect for the content &#8211; Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs. It does not teach about how to program, nor a specific programming language. Of course it is a legacy book. But it seems to me that I cannot get enough from this book unless I have mastered quite a few programming languages. After Dan taught me everything about basic aspects of programming languages and I played with Ruby and Racket for a long time, even after I leaned all those &#8220;nontrivial&#8221; trivial things about C++, when I read it now, I am able to distinguish which part is the essence and which part is written just for the ease of learning, and I can fully focus on how to put different abstractions into different layers&#8211; in other words, learning the structure and interpretation of computer programs.<br /><br />I read a comment, saying that Chapter 4 and 5 are the essence of the book. Hopefully, I can finish reading it before September, and leave enough time for Design Patterns.</div>

P59. I still don&#8217;t think it is necessary to use &#8220;square&#8221; instead of (* x x) everywhere we perform this operation, but I appreciate the idea of &#8220;abstraction&#8221;. It is really a good idea (and practice) to abstract concepts in different levels and use them accordingly.<br /><br />Most of the examples I read are in a top-down design manner: firstly use the abstract concepts, and then implement it in a lower level. The concerns for specific lower-level modules is similar to the way I did using unit test. But I am a little bit confuse how to perform the unit test in this manner. Especially for the closure using in LISP&#8211;implementing local helper functions right after building major function&#8211; how can I make sure the helper functions are right before I run the program as a whole? If I separate a helper function as an independent one, it seems that quite a little redundant work has to perform when I move it back to the major function.<br /><br />Anyway, SICP just makes me love Racket even more =D<br /><br />cheers,</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Before this accident, I did not even know there were so many places relevant with a single program… I opened the pandora’s box beginning with using <code>brew doctor</code> which told me to move directory /usr/local/bin/ prior to /usr/bin/ so that all the homebrewed packages could be found automatically. After I did this, if I executed matplotlib, I would have this runtime error <code>RuntimeError: module compiled against API version 8 but this version of numpy is 6</code> which was somewhat correct by the way. Because I used superpack installed the latest version of numpy(1.8), scipy(0.13), and matplotlib(1.4), but if I printed out the “numpy.<strong>version</strong>” in a script, it showed 1.6.1.</p>

<p>Then I tried the following solution:  </p>

<ol>
  <li>delete all of the outdated versions of numpy</li>
  <li>make sure I explicitly add PYTHONPATH in the bash_profile.</li>
  <li>I even uninstalled and reinstalled the numpy<br />
But the problem was still there…</li>
</ol>

<p>After an exhausted search, I found that numpy-1.6.1 in<br />
<code>/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/Extras/lib/python/ </code><br />
I still don’t know why it search into the directory of 2.6 given there is another 2.7 in the same level. Deleting both 2.6 and 2.7 directories (only delete the 2.6 could not work either…) finally solved the problem. ahooooo….</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The setup is much harder than I thought…</p>

<p>1) using homebrew installs the emacs and guile. Then, I also need to add path in the .bash_profile to launch the up-to-date emacs rather than the original version 22.1 shipped with the os.<br />
<code>export PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/emacs/24.3/bin:$PATH</code></p>

<p>2) Enable the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/162896/emacs-on-mac-os-x-leopard-key-bindings">Meta key in terminal</a>, or similar position for iterm2.</p>

<p>After these two steps, the following is more straightforward.</p>

<p>3) I accidentally found this “<a href="https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit">emacs-starter-kit</a>”, which had 2300+ stared and really saved my day. Just follow the instruction and everything will be fine.</p>

<p>In current state, I feel emacs kind of like vim+tmux. Anyway, learning new knowledge is always a pleasure, especially about this kind of “legacy” stuff.</p>

<p>cheers,</p>

<p>[UPDATE: after changed the loading sequence of bash in <code>/etc/paths/</code> the first step seems unnecessary… actually, that was something I should do as soon as I used homebrew to port packages. <a href="http://bit.ly/IUVl9a">http://bit.ly/IUVl9a</a>]</p>

(<a href="http://www.realworldtech.com/forum/?threadid=104299&amp;curpostid=104196">link</a>)<br /><br />&gt;Care to write an explicit example of a deep problem? (Except memory management - you already mentioned garbage collection.)<br /><br />Concurrency, for example.<br /><br />My point being, that C++ adds absolutely nothing interesting.<br /><br />&gt;All right. Then why do you think C should have support for structures (struct {&#8230;})?<br /><br />That&#8217;s just singularly stupid.<br /><br />C is a good language. It&#8217;s complete enough (and yes, the ability to handle structured data is very much required for any serious language) to be supremely useful, while at the same time being quite simple.<br /><br />A language without structured data types would not be a powerful language the way C is. You do need data structures, and you need pointers (to both data and code) to be at all interesting.<br /><br />But where do you draw the line?<br /><br />I know that you as a C++ proponent you probably won&#8217;t really &#8220;get&#8221; this simple argument, but try:<br /><br />- read the K&amp;R book on C (the ANSI edition), and be enlightened.<br /><br />Notice how the language is basically described by one rather thin book. Readably.<br /><br />So what C does so well is to do that whole &#8220;make it as simple as you can, but no simpler&#8221;. And that is what makes it great. The language is powerful, yet fairly minimal.<br /><br />There really aren&#8217;t many features you could remove from the C language without crippling it. Sure, there&#8217;s<br />three different looping constructs, and you could make trivial (syntactic) changes to the language, but that&#8217;s<br />really not the point. The language is simple, but without being too simple.<br /><br />Now, that&#8217;s not what you always want. I understand very well why people want less system-oriented languages with more built-in functionality. As mentioned, support for both garbage collection and concurrency are quite real problems, and they are both things you can do in C, but that you cannot do well with library interfaces, which is how you normally would extend on C.<br /><br />And garbage collection and concurrency are way more than just syntactic extensions. You can still do them very badly, of course, so it&#8217;s not a trivial path to go down, and I&#8217;m not saying hat a language magically becomes &#8220;good&#8221; just from supporting one or the other.<br /><br />But again: C does what it does very well, and with a clarity of thought and design that is entirely and utterly lacking from C++.<br /><br />And yes, I happen to think that clarity of thought and design is a good thing. It&#8217;s why I liked UNIX, even though I was initially introduced to other things (VMS - ugh).<br /><br />C++ is a mess. There&#8217;s no design. It&#8217;s just &#8220;add crud on top of C&#8221;. And the crud isn&#8217;t even meaningful, much less does it have a design. It&#8217;s totally and utterly random.<br /><br />It started out random, now it&#8217;s randomness that gets added to by a committee.<br /><br />&gt;For example, namespaces and function overloading are *not*<br />&gt;useless. They *do* solve a real problem that C is incapable<br />&gt;of solving.<br /><br />You&#8217;re full of it.<br /><br />&gt;For example, if you want in your source code to define a<br />&gt;function called &#8220;connect&#8221; and you also want include<br />&gt;&#8221;sys/socket.h&#8221;, you cannot do that in C.<br /><br />So to prove how it&#8217;s not just a syntactic feature, you start talking about syntax?<br /><br />What drugs are you on?<br /><br />The name overloading is a total syntactic feature. In C, the way you fix your problem is by a totally trivial syntactic change: you call your function &#8220;my_connect()&#8221;.<br /><br />Wow. It&#8217;s like magic. I added three characters, and made your whole reason for the crap that is C++ go away.<br /><br />The thing is, the above is a really good example of why C++ is horrible, and why C is so simple.<br /><br />Yes, the C solution is really simple. It&#8217;s so simple that it looks downright stupid. But it&#8217;s actually so simple that it is smart because quite frankly, it&#8217;s a lot easier to get confused in C++ code, when the same function name means totally different due to overloading.<br /><br />Of course, you&#8217;re not &#8220;supposed&#8221; to overload things in confusing ways, but the thing is, just do what C does: just make your function names unique. It&#8217;s not that hard, and by avoiding the overloading mess, you make it a lot easier to search for (hey look! &#8220;grep -w my_connect&#8221; just works!), and you avoid ambiguity.<br /><br />(Same exact thing goes for your other example: just add a module prefix or have some other trivial naming rules for your functional split-up, and be happy)<br /><br />Linus<br /><div><br /></div></div>
