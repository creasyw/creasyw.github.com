    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Oct. 1st. Private Lesson</p>

<ul>
  <li>The wrist for my forehand stroke is too tight. That is why I lost my power control. The right manner should relax the wrist in a <em>“controlled”</em> way, so as to gain the directional control as well as the power/spin control.</li>
  <li>It should be cautious to do the inside-out forehand stroke. That is, I have to leave enough time so that my whole body could arrive at the right position and then change my momentum from moving sideway to pushing forward. Or the return ball would sail away. On the contrary, preparing the backhand stroke needs less time, and now I do perform consistent backhand strokes. Hence, using strokes from both hand side no matter whether I am in the due side or ad side.</li>
  <li>I love the drill of “15 mid-court balls”. It’s a combination of cardio, toning, and quick attacking.</li>
  <li>The closer to the net, the shorter swing for the strokes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Oct. 8. Private Lesson</p>

<ul>
  <li>I can barely do the backhand back spin right, and now find that the forehand back spin is even harder. I should use more of my body momentum and fully extend my arm to the direction of returning so as to give the ball more penetration.</li>
  <li>Why do I always forget to split the feet as the opponent hit the ball?!</li>
  <li>The footwork of volley is similar to those of ground strokes–for the forehand side, I should do 2-steps stroke starting from right foot first. This would give me more foreword momentum.</li>
  <li>It is the same for the backhand side. The 1st step starting from the left foot should cut the angle rather than simply moving sideway, so that I could gain more forward power from the body movement.</li>
  <li>My recovering position should be more near the center for the forehand side, and recover much faster for the both sides… It is not hit-and-look-then-recover. Regardless my returns are legal, I should change my position according to my direction of return. This would give me much more time to prepare for the next shot.</li>
  <li>For the duel-side approach shots, it is better not to hit cross court, unless the opponent is far away from that side. Because it requires me to change the direction of moving and run quite a long distance to the left to response the next ball. In the contrary, if I hit down the line, I only need to go on running to the net.</li>
  <li>On the other hand, if the mid-court ball is in the middle between duel and ad sides, I can do whatever is right to deal with it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Oct. 9. Drill at ATC.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I have much better volleys when I keep my feet on the ground and move towards the coming ball. It is a good start to master how to end the point:)</li>
  <li>My ground stroke is off tempo for whatever reason… And I do not turn my body enough to generate the momentum driving the ball.</li>
  <li>I should get a little bit closer to the base line when I recover the position–half feet or one feet behind the base line might be a good distance. Prepare to moving forward at any time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Oct. 10. Gym.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It feels really nice get up at 5:30 and eating breakfast at 8 after hard workout.(:</li>
  <li>The modified version of <em>“bend over row”</em> that I watched in the <a href="http://youtu.be/T0LjSFng_ek?t=1m12s">Chauncey Billups NBA Fit</a> is good. It exercises the core, shoulder, and back muscles.</li>
  <li>When I watched the Shanghai Rolex Masters, I saw Djokovic had the really developed back and shoulder muscles. That might be a focus for my recent workouts.</li>
  <li>I also had a conversation with coach Bob. He prioritized the sections as first for core, second for lower body, and third for the upper body, in which the back and should should come before the chest and arms.</li>
  <li>I won’t do the full HIIT routine recently, but I should revisit it in the winter.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch07_Alone_Time.php">Alone Time</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Set up a rule at work: Make half the day alone time. — A successful alone time period means letting go of communication addiction. During alone time, give up instant messengers, phone calls, and meetings. Avoid any email thread that’s going to require an immediate response. Just shut up and get to work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html">Maker’s Schedule</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When we were working on our own startup, back in the 90s, I evolved another trick for partitioning the day. I used to program from dinner till about 3 am every day, because at night no one could interrupt me. Then I’d sleep till about 11 am, and come in and work until dinner on what I called “business stuff.” I never thought of it in these terms, but <strong>in effect I had two workdays each day</strong>, one on the manager’s schedule and one on the maker’s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000022.html">Human Task Switches Considered Harmful</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Programming is the kind of task where you have to keep a lot of things in your head at once. The more things you remember at once, the more productive you are at programming. A programmer coding at full throttle is keeping zillions of things in their head at once: everything from names of variables, data structures, important APIs, the names of utility functions that they wrote and call a lot, even the name of the subdirectory where they store their source code. <strong>If you send that programmer to Crete for a three week vacation, they will forget it all.</strong> The human brain seems to move it out of short-term RAM and swaps it out onto a backup tape where it takes forever to retrieve.</p>

  <p>In fact, the real lesson from all this is that you should <strong>never let people work on more than one thing at once</strong>. Make sure they know what it is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s not the excuse but the reason that I prefer working in my apartment (or Starbucks) rather than lab, where all kinds of weird situations would come up at any time… Anyway, the takeaway points are: I should pay more attention on my schedule, both for the long term and short term, to maximize the productivity; concentrate on one project (language, research topic) at a given period; extract the most out of it, celebrate, and then dive into another work.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sep. 9th. Tennis Club</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dealing with high-bounce top-spin balls, the feet should keep on the ground if possible. More importantly, the racket should be a little bit more open than the regular ground stroke, so that the response won’t hit the net.</li>
  <li>When I am running back, hit the ball higher.</li>
  <li>On the other hand, keep body momentum moving forward while hitting. If time is sufficient, turn body for both forehand and backhand stroke. This is similar to boxing, where the most powerful shot is generated by the whole body, not only just arms and shoulders.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sep. 10th. Private lesson.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Begin serving from the Ad-side.</li>
  <li>Toss the ball 45 degree towards the net.</li>
  <li>Toss higher.</li>
  <li>Bend knees is not just a gesture, but is for pushing the body upwards.</li>
  <li>Relax the wrist as much as I can.</li>
  <li>For practice, try to put two feet close to each other first, and then combine the movement of right foot from the regular position to the left foot.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sep. 13th. Mini-Match vs. Dylan</p>

<ul>
  <li>When I am trying to save the ball from backhand, the racket should fact “largely” to the other side rather than to the sky. Stay relatively at the same height of the touching point and push it, not chop it.</li>
  <li>After serving, instead of observing whether the bounce is valid, quickly retreat behind the base line.</li>
  <li>If there is no time to go back to the most comfortable hitting zone, just prepare early, relax wrist, and swing the racket after the bouncing point. There is a good chance I could still hit an acceptable return.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sep. 16th. Mini-Match vs. Eric.T.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It felt so nice that I am almost (or close to) as competent as one of the coaching staff one year ago in the very beginner class. Maybe it was because I could not push him to the fullest extent as what he did to me in the match. But, whatever, I had four games ending with multiple deuces, and I did won one of them. One is always a good start:)</li>
  <li>He cared less about the “percentage shoot” than what I did, but he would observe my movements and always tried to hit the open court. This would be my goal in (hopefully) three months.</li>
  <li>My serving is relatively stable now. I need to relax more, both physically and mentally, for both shoulder and wrist; to catch the ball a little bit higher; and to push it more upwards and forwards. Plus right direction of tossing and more practice, I could at least stop bleeding in my serving games.</li>
  <li>There are too many pieces missing from my repository. I am thinking to master back spin as the next step–for defense as well as changing the tempo of the match. After that, I will revisit ground stroke, transition from back court to mid-court, volley/over-head, and then serving again. All of them might take another month and a half. After that, I will seek a re-match with Eric and see how will that go.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sep. 18th. Private lesson and Drill</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learned how to do the backhand back spin:
    <ul>
      <li>To prepare, I should REALLY turn the body sideways. Use the left hand help to hold the racket.</li>
      <li>Prepare the racket a little bit higher. The slightly downwards movement will help to prevent the response floating much.</li>
      <li>The length of swing is longer than what I am used to for the double-handed backhand. So, swing early.</li>
      <li>The contact point is farther away from the body, so I should not over run or need to leave enough room for the swing.</li>
      <li>Relax the shoulder but not turn the waist too much. Meanwhile, lean body towards the net. That is, the majority of the force should be forward rather than to the right side.</li>
      <li>The face of racket should also face mainly towards the net.</li>
      <li>If possible, follow through the racket to the right side to give the ball more side spin.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When I did the volley, I should never jump at the same time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sep. 21th. Match with Reazul.H. (5-6, 7-6)</p>

<ul>
  <li>I’ve lost to this guy three times in a row in the league. So, I am really glad that today’s result could demonstrate my progress.</li>
  <li>His strategy puts defense in the 1st priority, waiting for me to earn the point or to make an unforced error. I have the controlled strokes for the most of the match. That’s great.</li>
  <li>When I can put the 1st serve in, the serving game becomes really easy to keep. In the 2nd set, maybe because of the tired, I have to breath really hard and to exhale out loud while serving. It actually helps me to keep the rhythm right. Of course, other points also hold: relax wrist, toss 45 degree in front of the body, toss high, bend knees and lift the whole body up, touch the ball in the highest point and push it upwards and forwards.</li>
  <li>I have several good drop shots and overhead hits, but those are not consistent. I need to work on it more. Exploring the 2D of the court is always worth trying–for consuming the opponent’s energy and disrupting his typo.</li>
  <li>Back spin by backhand does not work for most of the time…</li>
  <li>I should not retreat way back in the court unless the opponent has really good and strong top spin. Pushing forward is beneficial to enlarge the hitting angle and to put pressure to the other side. This is actually the only way to end a point. However, to achieve it, I need to prepare much earlier and turn sideways to add spin, and do the volley right–follow the route of the return, pause and split before the opponent hits the ball, keep both feet on the ground, and push the ball to the OPEN COURT!</li>
</ul>

<p>Sep. 25. Private lesson. 2-sets Match with Allen (3-6, 6-3)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Double-handed backhand should drive the racket to draw the logo of Nike. This would help me prepare a little bit higher, and have a smoother movement with better topspin. Two caveats are that I should begin the movement <em>earlier</em> since it takes longer time, and make the face of racket <em>less</em> open.</li>
  <li>I used to loose my wrist too much for the forehand ground stroke. I shouldn’t let the head of racket drop that much. Instead, I should use more of my arm/body movements to create the topspin. When I correct my movement, I can feel more of the directional control, but less of the power control–I overhit plenty of balls with the right direction. Maybe I should close more of the face of the racket, or it means that I do not provide enough spin. <em>I need to figure it out</em>.</li>
  <li>For the backhand backspin, I should extend my right arm to follow through the movement and use more of my right shoulder.</li>
  <li>My forehand volley “mysteriously” becomes better. During practice, I could easily drive the ball to either inside-in or inside-out. The backhand could still only do the inside-in. However, that is the practice. I ALWAYS forget to <em>split then react</em> during the match. It might be the reason that I find myself jumping while volley. So, do exactly what you practice for the match!</li>
  <li>The match was tough, and every game might easily go either way. I should figure out a solution during the match much quicker, and drive him running around the court more.</li>
</ul>

    <id>http://creasyw.github.io/blog/2014/08/30/third-season-of-3-dot-0-ends-up-with-2nd-place</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It was better than I expected:)</p>

<p>The main changes came from a few simple suggestions of my coach: keeping patient in rally; making percentage shoots and reducing unforced errors as many as possible; warming up longer than I used to; and balance myself while serving. That was it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I suppose my working out in gym also pays off. Several months ago, I started to divide the strength training to smaller parts as upper/lower/core body, along with cardio exercise. For each part, there are several different approaches to work out. Specifically for tennis, the back and core muscles are more important than those of chest and shoulder for ground strokes. A little bit exercises for the forearm could improve the penetration of serving a lot. Lower muscles are much much more important than I expected–they could provide more explosive strength, let running faster, and more importantly, protect the knee joints. Besides, pilate and stretch are indispensable parts for every workout. These last-30-minutes cooling down process help the body relax and keep up with everyday’s progress.</p>

<p>Of course, I still have plenty of REALLY weak aspects, such as lousy serving, bad backspin and volley, and getting lost in the mid-court…</p>

<p>Anyway, I am happy to get this level:) and wish myself could be the champion one day.</p>

<p>[UPDATE] 09/03/2014. I just saw the greatest match in this year, Murray vs. Djokovic. There are some interesting facts.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Both of them slided their feet together while hitting the serving, but when I did that way, my upper body would become unstable which in turn makes my serving even worse…</li>
  <li>Percentage shoots are the mainstream responses, and they would more inclined to approach to the net when hitting down the line.</li>
  <li>Both of them use lots of backspin for defense, but their movements seemed to have more “chopping” than I did. And if I did that way, the ball would float very high and sail…</li>
  <li>Drop shots are effective means to explore the depth of the court. Making the opponents running is almost always a good strategy to disrupt the tempo as well as actively draining off the energy.</li>
  <li>Mental toughness is the key to win the match.</li>
</ul>

<p>[UPDATE] 09/09/2014. I won’t sign up for any 3.0 League in this year since I’ve began to play the tournament in the university. It has less challenging mentally, but more physically. The strategic play is still useful, but I would also expect longer rally and have more cadio-/HIIT training correspondingly.</p>

    <id>http://creasyw.github.io/blog/2014/07/17/3-dot-0-league-for-the-third-time</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are two dimensions for a court. I just kept forgetting it! It is always worthwhile to explore both left/right and mid/back of the court. As an amateur like me, the most struggling part might be forced to constantly adjust the tempo. I should keep pushing in this kind of manner more often.</p>

<p>It is almost always a wiser choice to stick to the “percentage shot” for both forehand and backhand. I had too many unforced errors hitting down the line. However, on the other hand, when I stand in the middle of the court, I should be more comfortable to change the direction. For most of the opponents, they would struggle more in their backhands. So I could try more inside-out.</p>

<p>I have a better volley technique, but am still awful in both timing and positioning. I can serve with more power, and a little bit more consistent. The next step will be taking more control in direction. Besides, I need to prepare earlier/higher and hit with looser wrist for the ground stroke. I also need push the momentum forward when I hit the ball. It’s almost one year since I learned this activity, but I still cannot master its most basic part…</p>

<p>Well, anyhow =D</p>

<p>[UPDATE 20/07/2014: I just had a big victory this afternoon: 6-1 and 6-2, against the guy who used to beat me twice. Although it would never be a big deal for winning or losing an amateur game, I still feel really happy for that. I have more control for percentage shot and decrease unforced errors a lot.</p>

<p>Aiming higher in the net also could push opponent further away from the court, then have a better chance receiving a shallow response, and then move into the court, hit down the line, and move forward more for volley – this is a right sequence from building to ending a point. Deep balls with strong top spin would seldom be a good chance to change the direction. Instead, just hit cross court and try to be as deep as I can, meanwhile aiming bouncing towards the baseline rather than the side line.</p>

<p>Maybe it’s really useful to keep thinking both during the match and afterwards, it makes me evolve stronger; or maybe my exercises of lower body and core muscles finally pay out; or maybe my resting and eating schedule give me more energy to do the movements right; or more possibly, my opponent just had a bad day. Well…</p>

<p>I love this game, both mentally and physically(:  ]</p>

<p>[UPDATE 24/07/2014: Lost a game. However, anyway, the take-way points are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Prepare earlier.</li>
  <li>Be patient. Anyone could make mistakes in any time.</li>
  <li>Be relax when serving.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="tennis-and-exercises">Tennis and Exercises</h3>

<p>Until now, I’ve played three matches in this round of 3.0 league, lost twice (6-3, 6-3; and another was 7-5 for two hours and left unfinished), and won once (6-4, 1-6, 10-5). My improvements are quite obvious, but still not big enough for me to turn previous loses towards the same opponents to landslide victories. To the maximum extent, I would not lose a set 4 points straight, but stuck in “deuce…add-in…deuce..add-out…” loops.</p>

<p>These are some aspects I should pay attention to</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do NOT make decisions before hitting the balls. They should depend on how good my response is, as well as the position and momentum of my opponent.</li>
  <li>During the point building, keep percentage shots as long as I can.</li>
  <li>And DISTINGUISH it from capitalizing.</li>
  <li>Do NOT be afraid of volley, and do NOT rush it.</li>
  <li>For current level, attacking the back-hand side is almost always a good choice.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, I don’t have any blank left for any tech. aspect, but almost everything needs to be further improved: adding more top spin for both forehand and backhand ground stroke, being more consistent of back spin in half-volley, splitting timely and positioning myself more appropriate as approaching to the net, and better serving.</p>

<h3 id="trip">Trip</h3>

<p>It was great to see the awesome grand canyon, as well as the horseshoe bend and the antelope valley, and it sucked as I recalled the trip of yellowstone every minute in every day. I thought I had got over of the devastation after seven months. But this trip just proved that I was wrong in a hard way.</p>

<p>I will not rush myself to the conclusion of “feeling well” again, and will not do another trip in the near future.</p>

<h3 id="programming-and-online-courses">Programming and Online Courses</h3>

<p>“Know how to solve every problem that has been solved.” – Richard Feynman</p>

<p>There are many things that I need to prepare before the graduate and really job-hunting. Actually, there are more things in my mind than I could complete. So I should choose wisely.</p>

<p>Currently, I am enrolled in the course “Principle of Computing” offered by Rice University in Coursera. It’s easy in general, but interesting to re-think those small games mathematically with the “programming” point of view. Besides, I also continue reading SICP and solving the problems in each chapter. I also go on reading books for Haskell, and watching a course about artificial intelligent in edX. Combining with what I have learned in machine learning and algorithm, I should have a better grasp about what to do and how to do in this field of study. On the other hand, I’ve also dropped off several courses for too much overlapping with what I have already known, or for tedious pedagogy and far-fetched implementations.</p>

<p>I have extensively used Emacs for this summer. Sometimes, I even appreciate its methodology more than I do for Vim, though I would still prefer Vim for 90% of occasions. After tried and failed several times to customize it from scratch, I started beginning with Prelude, and then piling other stuff on it. Despite in favor of most its adds-on, I disable the Viper mode. The logic behind is that if I want to use a Vim, I will use the Vim. Before I fully appreciate its advantages and disadvantages, I would like to keep Emacs as it is. Currently, I use Haskell and Racket in it. It does do a better job than Vim for Haskell, and DrRacket for Racket. Besides, I have tried twice of adopting R in current work, but still cannot find a scenario exclusively using it. It’s not really good at modeling (LISP or Haskell), visualization (matplotlib in Python, JavaScript, or Mathematica), computational efficiency (C++, or Haskell), or just for fun (LISP, ML, or Ruby). Given it is THE favorite language of some of my very smart friends, I will give it another try whenever possible.</p>

<h3 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>

<p>Doing some experiments on myself is fun and worthwhile. For example, I have tried several days to go to bed earlier than I usually do. My feeling is more or less the same as what said in <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/06/27/sleep-as-a-competitive-advantage/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=1&amp;">“Sleep as a Competitive Advantage”</a>, and I will stick to it.</p>

<p>Because I need to toss the tennis ball better, I use my left hand as often as I can, such as drawing diagrams or doing all kinds of doodle/calculations. It’s too soon to tell if I have any progress. I am also trying different ways to brew coffee. Pour-over versus press pot seems like another version of Emacs versus Vim.</p>

  <li>The ability to visualize the consequences of the actions under consideration is crucial to becoming an expert programmer.</li>
  <li>Procedures that manipulate procedures, including accept them as arguments or return them as values, are called <em>higher-order procedures</em>. (The <em>sigma</em> summation and the derivative operation are all good/simple examples for the latter case.) This is one of the basic characteristics of <em>factional programming languages</em>.</li>
  <li>The significance of higher-order procedures is that they enable us to represent these abstractions explicitly as elements in our programming language, so that they can be handled just like other computational elements……As programmers, we should be alert to opportunities to identify the underlying abstractions in our programs and to build upon them and generalize them to create more powerful abstractions……It poses challenges for efficient implementation, but the resulting gain in expressive power is enormous.</li>
  <li>As with compound procedures, the main issue is to be addressed is that of abstraction as a technique for coping with complexity, while the data abstraction enables us to erect suitable <em>abstraction barriers</em> between different parts of a program.</li>
  <li>In general, the underlying idea of data abstraction is to identify for each type of data object a basic set of operations in terms of which all manipulations of data objects of that type will be expressed, and then to use only those operations in manipulating the data.</li>
  <li>The approach of <em>stratified design</em> is the notion that a complex system should be structured as a sequence of levels that are described using a sequence of languages. Each level is constructed by combining parts that are regarded as primitive at that level, and the parts constructed at each level are used as primitives at the next level. The language used at each level of a stratified design has primitives, means of combinations, and means of abstraction appropriate to that level of detail.</li>
  <li>(Thoughts) I thought local binding with “let/let*/letrec” are similar to what I did in the imperative programming in a sense that I was telling the program what to do. However, this is not the essence. The local binding is the part of paper which contains the “where…” after a complicated formula. It is the way for data abstract.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<ul>
  <li>Ideally, every time hitting the ball should be a “kinetic chain of reactions”– the momentum moves from feet to knee, to waist, to shoulder, and finally to the forearm and wrist.</li>
  <li>If I only use part of the chain, I might still hit a good ball, occasionally. But it would consume more energy, and the hitting would be much more unstable.</li>
  <li>Technically speaking, serve is the only way that I can completely control this kinetic chain, because I can control all of the paces and do not need to move around.</li>
  <li>During a point, whenever opponent hits the ball, I should pause and split feet, no matter where I am in the court. This could help me make judgment. More importantly, it is the way to “load energy” and start the “kinetic chain”.</li>
  <li>I have too many aspects to improve, but this might be the most important one.</li>

    <id>http://creasyw.github.io/blog/2014/04/12/thought-process-in-a-tennis-match</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last Thursday, I had another win in the league(: In my point of view, I was pretty lucky for the previous victories, but I did have an overwhelming victory this time. I was much better than one month ago (yeah! of course=P), and the opponent was a sub-player, who was weaker than others in the league. Although he had a strong surfing, both his forehand and backhand were not so good. The responses were soft and shallow with only a little bit back spin, which gave me a wide angel to hit either inside-in or inside-out.</p>

<p>When I talked with my coach yesterday, he provided some valuable insights about how I should consider the process of a match</p>

<ul>
  <li>Keep the feet floating while preparing ground stroke.</li>
  <li><strong>Volley is the only way to end a point</strong>. No matter how aggressive the ground strokes are, they are not considered to end the point. Instead, they just <em>build</em> the point. If it ends, let it be. If not, that’s the normal case. It means I should always prepare for the next stroke. And the sad part of the story is that after nine months I still don’t really know how to end a point……</li>
  <li>Do not get frustrated playing with players who consistently send lofty backspin. If he voluntarily hands over the control of pace, I should use it wisely: add more topspin on the returns; actively change the angel; don’t rush to end the point but patiently build it.</li>
  <li>Prepare earlier: decide to use forehand or backhand based on the trajectory; once decided, prepare for the ready position; after the bounce, I should begin the movement of hitting; the center of gravity should put into the front halves of the feet, and always keep the momentum forward while hitting the ball.</li>
</ul>

    <updated>2014-04-05T09:47:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://creasyw.github.io/blog/2014/04/05/survive-on-busy-two-weeks</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am glad that I could survive on three-hours sleep per day for almost two weeks. Of course, there were quite a few downsides: I felt very weak after the first several days, and the feeling lasted till the end; I lost 1 and dropped the other 2 times of tennis matches in this period; my Github longest streak of contribution stopped at 200 days, which is the date right before my comprehensive defense…</p>

<p>The things that I completed in return include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A 96-pages thesis for the comprehensive defense</li>
  <li>A collection of decent slides built by Beamer/Latex for defense</li>
  <li>Passed it =D</li>
  <li>A part of one NSF proposal</li>
  <li>One research paper submitted to Globecom’14</li>
  <li>Mid-term II of Game Theory</li>
  <li>One reviewing paper from EuraSip</li>
  <li>The least amount of homework and projects in Coursera that keep me within the schedule</li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, there are lots of lessons to take away from this process. Concerning the defense about research, I find myself still need to adjust the strategy handling problems. In research, it is not about getting thing done, but about how to propose the right question (relevant with the basic/advanced theorems of the related fields) and to make at least some sense out of it.</p>

<p>For the research, I should not pile up most of the work to the last week of the due date, especially when I could anticipate this busy schedule months before. In Jan. and Feb., I did waste plenty of time to try out different algorithms handling the problem, but none of them had the “sky-high” performances, so I just kept trying. Eventually, when the time run out, I chose the “sub-optimal” solution and wrote the paper in a hurry. This should not be the right way. Sometimes, when the theoretical merits are fascinating, I might need to only derive the theorems and formulas with some naive simulations. When the trial and error process has to perform, I should set a “early termination” threshold and record every “best effort” in different scenarios. It will help me leisurely handle the due date, and maybe produce more work/papers.</p>

<p>I hope I won’t have this kind of busy schedule again, in the sense that I have a better planning and complete each work as soon as I can.</p>

    <updated>2014-03-01T14:29:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://creasyw.github.io/blog/2014/03/01/strategic-playing-for-the-first-several-sets</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It is worth noting that yesterday I had my first win in the 3.0 league=D 7-5, 3-6, and 10-6 in the tie-breaker set. In today’s lesson, Bob told me a bit more about strategic playing. It was all about probing different aspects of the opponent.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Keep hitting in the middle (or either left or right) as long as I can, and see what is the tolerance of the opponent – whether him or me would get frustrated first and try to make some change.</li>
  <li>Consistently push either his backhand or forehand within a point.</li>
  <li>Driving the ball from side to side and observe the pattern of his transition – does he have a high successful rate for the ground stroke while moving? Is his forehand-to-backhand better or worse than the backhand-to-forehand? Does he tend to hit cross court or staight down to the line?</li>
</ul>

<p>The advanced version will also include the timing of pushing towards the net as well as volley, but I haven’t got there yet… I am still struggling to position myself in the transition of volley, let alone the judgement of lobbing or cut-across from my opponent… So, there is a long way to go(:</p>

<p>[Update March 7] The control of my ground stroke is nice, but the hitting point is far from optimal – I should keep the racquet a little bit “closer” and the hitting point should be a little bit in front while the racquet rising in its maximum speed and facing towards the net. Still, The target zone is “higher in the net”.</p>

<p>[Update March 15] The way to increase spin is to make the preparison faster and to prepare the racquet a little bit lower–all movements should be done before the bonuce.</p>

  <li><a href="https://github.com/magit/magit">Magit</a>. “Magit is the most popular interface to git. If you are new to git and do not need support for other vcs this is likely the package you should try first” – quoted from <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Git">EmacsWiki</a>.

</ul>

<h3 id="random-thoughts">Random Thoughts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>One of the most fundamental change from Vim to Emacs is that Vim is the most powerful editor in this planet while Emacs is kind of <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?EmacsAsOperatingSystem">“operating system” with a lousy editor</a>. It might be a rant to the right place, but anyway, the other side of the story is that emacs can be regarded as an OS which means that it might be much more powerful when the configuration is right. I should be able to do things that are used to complete via the combination of vim, shell, REPL, and compiler, and I SHOULD NOT launch and exit it very often as what I am doing with vim.</li>
  <li>Everything looks a little bit more decent within the emacs,
including the shell.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="useful-key-combinings">Useful Key Combinings:</h3>

<p>Kill a line:
C-a C-k (move the cursor to the begining of the line, thenkill from the cursor to the end of the line)</p>

<p>Kill 2 lines: C-a C-u 2 C-k</p>

<p>Kill a specific region
C-&lt;SPC&gt; C-w (move around to highlight region, then kill contents within highlight region)</p>

<p>Yank the killed contents C-y</p>

<p>Retrieve yanking history
M-y (right after the 1st yanking. – this is intersting)</p>

<p>The difference between “killing” and “deleting” is that “killed” text
can be reinserted (at any position), whereas “deleted” things cannot
be reinserted in this way (you can, however, undo a deletion–see below).
Reinsertion of killed text is called “yanking”.  Generally, the
commands that can remove a lot of text kill the text (they are set up so
that you can yank the text), while the commands that remove just one
character, or only remove blank lines and spaces, do deletion (so you
cannot yank that text).  &lt;DEL&gt; and C-d do deletion in the simplest
case, with no argument.  When given an argument, they kill instead.
– This is valid for both vim and emacs.</p>

<p>Multiple windows:
- C-x 0  delete this window
- C-x 1  delete all other windows
- C-x 2  vertically split window
- C-x 3  split window side by side</p>

<p>Scoll down the page
- C-v (page down)
- C-u 8 C-v (scoll down 8 lines)
- C-l (move the current line to the middle of the window)
- C-u 0 C-l (move the current line to the head of the window)</p>

<p>Getting help
- C-h c &lt;Command sequence&gt;   (a very brief description of the command.)
- C-h k &lt;Command sequence&gt;   (displays the documentation of the function, as well as its name)</p>

<p>Auto-completion
- M-/
- <a href="http://company-mode.github.io/">Company</a> is good complementory plug-in</p>

<p>Shell History (also Useful for Haskell REPL)
- M-p (or) C-&lt;UP&gt;: Fetch the next earlier old shell command.
- M-n (or) C-&lt;DOWN&gt;: Fetch the next later old shell command.
- M-r: Begin an incremental regexp search of old shell commands.
- C-c C-x: Fetch the next subsequent command from the history.
- C-c . : Fetch one argument from an old shell command.
- C-c C-l: Display the buffer’s history of shell commands in another window (comint-dynamic-list-input-ring).</p>

<h3 id="missing-features">Missing Features:</h3>

<p>This is a list for what I should expand the functionalities of my Emacs.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Highlight symbol at the point. There is <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/HighlightSymbol">a package</a> for this purpose, but currently it does not work well within Prelude.</li>
  <li>Interactive input for M-x.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>没有想到，这一年能发生这么多的事情。效率从年初开始，越来越高。然后是暑假实习，认识了很多有趣的人，开始打网球。去了波多黎各和维京群岛，看到一生迄今为止最蓝的海。回来后继续打网球，开始瘦身，失散了三十年的六块腹肌和人鱼线都找到了，可年末却把豆豆丢了。痛彻心扉的最后两个月，不太清楚自己是怎么度过的。</p>

<h3 id="statistics">Statistics:</h3>

<p>过去的一年，在学校里修了两门课，GPA还是4.0。发表了三篇文章，还有三篇在等消息，两篇在写，为IEEE Trans. of Signal Processing 和ICC2014 审了两篇论文。此外，在Coursera上完成了6门课，其中收获最大的有Dan Grossman 的Programming Language 以及Tim Roughgarden 的Algorithm Analysis I &amp; II。比较可惜的是Andrew Ng 的 Machine Learning，课程和作业都过半了，但因为自己的论文进度太紧，这门课最终还是没能完成。希望它来年还能再开。</p>

<p>根据豆瓣上的统计，这一年我看完19本书，听了27盘专辑，看了50部电影。其中看过最好看的书是现在还没有读完的巨著SICP…好看的电影包括Argo, The Social Network, Now You See Me, and Star Trek Into Darkness；听歌因为大量使用Douban FM 和Pandora，已经无法具体记录了。另外，完成了2325小时的编程。从九月到年底，用nike running 跑了110 miles，越跑越快，从九月份的7’36”/mi 到十二月的6’47”/mi。体重从78公斤降低到现在的68公斤，腹部和手臂的肌肉都清晰可见了。还有很多东西没有量化，比如网球的一发成功率，主动得分，以及非受迫性失误，等等。</p>

<h3 id="programming">Programming:</h3>

<p>在Coursera上的几门课程对我帮助很大，从熟悉新的编程语言，到高屋建瓴的指导如何实践。这一年新学的语言包括ML, Scala, Ruby, and Haskell，其中前三个都是课程里涉及的。编程时间的积累已经过半，到了5750小时。从简历上，我可以堆出一大坨熟练使用的语言。而对自己而言，进步最大的有两方面。其一，现在可以用很短的时间，甚至是一个下午，去学习一门新的编程语言，其实只用熟悉常用的语法就好，其中的范式和思想都是共通的。其二，对于算法和数据结构的掌握，让我能在更短的时间里将一个具体问题转变成模型。</p>

<p>这一年也花了大量的时间写C++代码，实习里用到了，自己的项目也用到了。但写来写去，依然不喜欢这个语言——繁琐，庞大高效，想做所有的事情却鲜有亮点。用Jobs描述微软的词语来形容C++也是合适的，no taste。使用它，仅仅是因为所处状况暂时没有其他选择而已。在2014年里，计划将实验室的项目逐渐向Haskell过渡，当必须使用OOP的时候，用Scala。至于继续提高的方向，暂时还没想到什么新的语言特别值得学习(maybe Lua, R, or Javascript)，但需要花时间把Compiler看完，然后读完三本2013积攒下来的书：SICP, The Scheme Programming Language，和Real World Haskell。若是此外还有空余，可以旁听一下iOS的课程，重温一下已经放下两年的Obj-C。</p>

<p>因为Haskell的缘故，这几个月越来越多的使用Emacs。发觉一个有关它的笑话大体是对的，Emacs的启动时间都足够用Vim写完一个脚本了。当然，依此类推，启动Eclipse都足够写完一个项目了。。。现在我主要还是是把Emacs当Vim来用，除了C-c C-l来加载Haskell的Compiler，我只不过是在使用Vim里对应的快捷键组合来写程序。我也知道，有关Emacs最吸引人的.el 脚本，我还没有过多涉及。希望在接下来的一年里，我能像使用Vim一样熟练的使用Emacs，有一套自己的加载脚本，多一个得心应手的开发工具。</p>

    <updated>2013-10-09T18:21:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://creasyw.github.io/blog/2013/10/09/lte-reading-excerpt</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The LTE-Advanced introduced by LTE standard release 10 has many new features, including the carrier aggregation, enhanced intercell interferernce coordination (ICIC) for heterogeneous networks (HetNets), enhanced multiple-antenna transmission supporting up to eight downlink layers, and relaying and coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission.</p>

<p>For the carrier aggregation, in order to fully compliant with the IMT-Advanced requirements, the radio-access technology in LTE-Advanced does not only provide entensive support for deployment in spectrum allocations with bandwides ranging from 1 MHz to 20 MHz for backwards compatibility, but also extends by means of carrier aggregation, where multiple component carriers are aggregated and jointly used for transmission to/from a signle terminal. Up to five component carriers, possibly each of different bandwidth, can be aggregated, allowing for transmission bandwidth up to 100 MHz. The component carriers that a UE needs to support are determined through a UE-specific configuration process and a dynamic activation and deactivation process. Due to this activation/deactivation process, the state of SCells can be changed frequently. As a result, <strong>radio link monitoring is only supported in the PCell but not in SCells to avoid complex UE behavior and additional control signaling overhead. Despite this kind of effort, the increased complexity due to physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) decoding and timing tracking of multiple component carriers cannot be avoided</strong>. </p>

<p>The receiver RF filter design depends on the type of carrier aggregation. For the interest of low hardware complexity, a singular RF chain is preferable. But it requires an analog-to-digital converter and RF filter with larger bandwidth. Moreover, due to activation and deactivation of component carriers, there is a retuning issue when a single RF is used for these component carriers. <strong>There should be techniques balancing the packet loss due to RF retuning and the measurement of deactivated SCells to achieve optimal network performance</strong>.</p>

<p>A HetNet consists of low-power picocells and femtocells in addition to high-power macrocells to improve end-users QoS. But this benefit comes at the cost of additional intercell interference between heterogeneous cells, and some of the femtocells might be closed subscriber group, which make the strongest downlink power at the viewpoint of certain UE be the interference. Besides, the commeon reference signal (CRS), synchronization signals, and physical broadcast channel (PBCH) are transmitted in almost blank subframe (ABS), which cause the collision among different Scells. **The interference cancellation should developed based on the release 8/9 which soly considers the macrocell interference management through ABS.</p>

<p>The LTE-Advanced system should fulfill the ITU requirements of the downlink peak spectral efficiency of 30 b/s/Hz. The peak spectral efficiency is the highest achievable data rate per overall cell bandwidth assuming error-free conditions when all available radio resources for the corresponding link direction are assigned to a single UE unit. While two- or four-layer transmission would be more prevalent even for the LTE-Advanced system, the required downlink peak spectral efficiency can only be attained using high-order antenna configurations (i.e., 8 × 8). <strong>The main challenge of high-order multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is computational complexity</strong>. Maximum likelihood (ML) detection is optimal in the sense that it minimizes error probability when the distributions of all data are equally likely. However, due to its high complexity in 8×8 MIMO systems with high modulation order, a direct implementation of ML detection might not be a viable option for such MIMO systems.</p>

<p>The alternatives are zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) detection, but both of them are much worse in performance compared with ML. The k-best detection is another choice, but although its performance is close to ML, its computational complexity is still high to be implemented in the real-world multi-antennas configurations.</p>

<p>In the UE, channel estimation is for feeding back channel state information (CSI) to the base station and equalization of the downlink channel in the process of data demodulation. One of the requirements for LTE-Advanced is that it should support up to eight-layer transmission, which implies that there need to be at least eight transmit antenna ports. Toward this, a key change in the reference signal design philosophy from LTE Release 8 is the separation of the demodulation reference signals (DM-RS) from the channel state information reference signals (CSI-RS) in Release 10. The up-side is saving significant reference signal overhead since it allows the densely populated DM-RS to be UE-specific. The down-side is that in order to provide for eight CSI-RS patterns, the density of CSI-RS in LTE-Advanced is significantly less than that of CRS, that is, there is only one CSI-RS resource element (RE) per RB per antenna port. Besides, CSI-RS is expected to be transmitted only once every five or ten sub-frames. <strong>Advanced algorithms are needed for CSI-RS-based channel estimation and computation of the CSI feedback parameters such as CQI (i.e., modulation and coding rate) because existing methods may incur throughput degradation and/or result in a failure to meet the target BLER requirements.</strong> Possible strategies to improve the CSI-RS channel estimation performance could include exploitation of the time-frequency correlations, the channel’s power delay profile (PDP) and the Doppler shift. </p>

    <updated>2013-09-30T23:49:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://creasyw.github.io/blog/2013/09/30/johnsons-algorithm</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The question comes from the online course <em>Algorithm Design and Analysis (Part II)</em> in coursera. It is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem#All-pairs_shortest_paths">all-pairs shortest path problem</a>. As mentioned in the wikipedia, a more straightforward solution with Floyd–Warshall algorithm takes \(O(N^3)\) complexity, and the more computational efficient approach is to use a combination of Dijkstra’s algorithm, Bellman-Ford algorithm, and Johnson’s algorithm, which chould decrease the complexity to \(O(N^2logN)\). I implement the latter one for more interesting and challenging. There are several obstacles make the implementation a little bit trickier than I thought.</p>

<p>I have tried two or three different versions of Dijkstra’s algorithm while solving other math puzzles, and this time I use the built-in heapq function in Python. Keeping the “about-to explore” nodes in order and extracting the smallest/largest cost one in every iteration are the essense of this algorithm. But the cost to every node has to be updated when a node moves from “about-to explore” to “fully explored” category. At first, I just remove the original value and push the updated one into the heap. Because the heapq has no updated or remove methods, I can only use the remove mehtod of the list. This works fine for small amount of nodes (200) but the heap cannot keep right struture when the data becomes just a little bigger (500). Then I have to <em>heapify</em> it every time I update a “about-to explore” node.</p>

<p>The Bellman-Ford algorithm is more expensive compared with Dijkstra’s algirhtm if the graph is densily connected, but it deals with negative edge cost. This is also the one that helps me fully appreciate the dynamic programming.The implementation is intuitive and straightforward. For every vertex, the brutal force search performs to find the current optimal solution based on the previous knowledge. The optimization for space complexity is to only store the most recent result–keep an 2*N array and use a pointer filp-flop in every iteration is more effecient than keeping two 1*N array, discarding the older one and reclaiming a new one in every iteration. Aother optimization I make is to store the “about-to explore” nodes in a bucket, just as what Dijkstra’s does, which eliminates plenty of unnecessary calculation. But its tricky aspect is that because this algorithm is computing “distributed”, different from the “centralized” spanning of Dijkstra’s, if several “exploring” vertices point to a same “about-to explore” vertex, only the optimal cost should be kept.</p>

<p>Finally, the two algorithms above are connected by the Johnson’s algorithm. Dijkstra’s algorithm cannot deal with negative edge costs, but much more fast than Bellman-Ford especially in the case of “all-pairs”. Furthermore, the negative costs cannot be got rid of by adding uniformly for every edge. Johnson’s algorithm neatly solves it by adding pseudo-node to find weights of vertices and changing values of edges concerning their connected vertices. There is no hidden obstacle in the implementation. Only the special care should be taken for manipulating the nodes. It reminds me coding in C…</p>

<p>The overall algorithm solves the question and runs kind of standard. Still, I do not satisfy with the update procedure of heap. I will write a new version of this data structure in the near future and see if it can provide significant boost for the performance.</p>

    <updated>2013-08-15T00:15:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://creasyw.github.io/blog/2013/08/15/more-freedom-in-doing-things</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I heard lots of opinions from both Mac lovers and haters before I bought my macbook pro. It made me struggle for a while to leverage the pros and cons. But it finally turned out neither of them was completely right. I love my mbp very much, but the reason is not the good looking, but the flexibility interacting with unix programs and great ease using homebrew for almost all dependent packages. Besides, if I was not forced using Windows OS again in my internship, I would not notice how ugly and inconvenient it is.</p>

<p>The same process happened once again when I met latex. The final result was that I fell in love with it, and found out no one gave me a comprehensive description about it before.</p>

<p>LaTeX is more about higher-level accessing Tex for formating and typesetting. That is it. The focus for writing, the ease of math formulas, and even the licensing advantage over MS are all derivatives from others personal experiences. Actually, the basic intention gives it the most attractive feature. First of all, setting up a general framework, then maybe another subset of framework. The framework is at will, but everything fell into it must follow the specific rules. Then, beyond the framework, or within the framework, everything is also at will. One can freely design all specifications, and if needed, one can also overwrite the general rules set by the framework. On the one hand, the environment setting let author get rid of all trivial concerns. On the other hand, in every place, one can regain the control of everything. LaTeX is not only for writing, it is for programming.</p>

<p>Then, several days ago, I was trying to transfer my blog from Blogger to Jekyll. It is a static site generator that takes Markdown blog posts and onverts them into html files. The benefits are attractive: the website can be hosted by almost any server; the whole blog can easily be version controlled, since no php or MySQL needed, it requires less maintainance. During playing with it, I have the same kind of feeling again. I might easily mess everything up while on the other hand I have fully control of every element in the page.</p>

<p>I cannot build it without kind-hearted help from others. Especially,</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/yanga9">Alex Yang</a>, who designs this theme. I really like the succinct layout and the Hello page. His comprehensive introductory email also saved me lots of time and gave me solid understanding of how jekyll and octopress work.</li>
  <li><a href="http://octopress.org/docs/setup/">Octopress: Getting started</a> and an <a href="http://labs.grupow.com/blog/2012/01/30/start-blogging-with-octopress">alternative post</a>. Provide fool-proof tutorials of setting things up. For the latter post, there is no need to insall Pow. The “rake preview” will get the result with <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17465404/rake-preview-not-working-in-octopress">one precaution</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://gist.github.com/juniorz/1564581">Import from Blogger</a>. This script was found from Jekyll official site.</li>
  <li><a href="http://conghui.github.io/2013/04/27/did-not-find-expected-key-while-parsing-a-block-mapping/">Rake Generate issue caused by double quotes</a>. The script above cannot well handle double quotes, which will cause problem when generating yaml. Here is the solution.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, there are some other things that I tried and failed to like. C++ might be an example… =P Anyway, my point is, regardless what other people say, you will never know what a thing really is unless you actually do it. There is one ultimate goal for a given project, and at least one suitable path to get there. Just do it. Then in retrospect, we will know if it is a better option, and will perform better the next time.</p>

  I really appreciate the exercises within each subsections, because I can feel that they are well designed. I used to have the same feeling when I did the homework from Dan&#8217;s course of programming languages. The exercises make the general concepts concrete and doable.
  <br/><br/>
  The abstraction is far from merely making the code more structured and readable. It is a design choice. Sometimes, it takes experience to find out where should be abstracted. And sometimes, it takes much more endeavors than simply mix everything together. But once the choice of abstraction is right, the program becomes clearer, and it increases many degrees of freedom for the design afterwards.</div>
