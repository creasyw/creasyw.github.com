  <div class="entry-content"><ul>
  <li>The ability to visualize the consequences of the actions under consideration is crucial to becoming an expert programmer.</li>
  <li>Procedures that manipulate procedures, including accept them as arguments or return them as values, are called <em>higher-order procedures</em>. (The <em>sigma</em> summation and the derivative operation are all good/simple examples for the latter case.) This is one of the basic characteristics of <em>factional programming languages</em>.</li>
  <li>The significance of higher-order procedures is that they enable us to represent these abstractions explicitly as elements in our programming language, so that they can be handled just like other computational elements……As programmers, we should be alert to opportunities to identify the underlying abstractions in our programs and to build upon them and generalize them to create more powerful abstractions……It poses challenges for efficient implementation, but the resulting gain in expressive power is enormous.</li>
  <li>As with compound procedures, the main issue is to be addressed is that of abstraction as a technique for coping with complexity, while the data abstraction enables us to erect suitable <em>abstraction barriers</em> between different parts of a program.</li>
  <li>In general, the underlying idea of data abstraction is to identify for each type of data object a basic set of operations in terms of which all manipulations of data objects of that type will be expressed, and then to use only those operations in manipulating the data.</li>
  <li>The approach of <em>stratified design</em> is the notion that a complex system should be structured as a sequence of levels that are described using a sequence of languages. Each level is constructed by combining parts that are regarded as primitive at that level, and the parts constructed at each level are used as primitives at the next level. The language used at each level of a stratified design has primitives, means of combinations, and means of abstraction appropriate to that level of detail.</li>
  <li>(Thoughts) I thought local binding with “let/let*/letrec” are similar to what I did in the imperative programming in a sense that I was telling the program what to do. However, this is not the essence. The local binding is the part of paper which contains the “where…” after a complicated formula. It is the way for data abstract.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><ul>
  <li>Ideally, every time hitting the ball should be a “kinetic chain of reactions”– the momentum moves from feet to knee, to waist, to shoulder, and finally to the forearm and wrist.</li>
  <li>If I only use part of the chain, I might still hit a good ball, occasionally. But it would consume more energy, and the hitting would be much more unstable.</li>
  <li>Technically speaking, serve is the only way that I can completely control this kinetic chain, because I can control all of the paces and do not need to move around.</li>
  <li>During a point, whenever opponent hits the ball, I should pause and split feet, no matter where I am in the court. This could help me make judgment. More importantly, it is the way to “load energy” and start the “kinetic chain”.</li>
  <li>I have too many aspects to improve, but this might be the most important one.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last Thursday, I had another win in the league(: In my point of view, I was pretty lucky for the previous victories, but I did have an overwhelming victory this time. I was much better than one month ago (yeah! of course=P), and the opponent was a sub-player, who was weaker than others in the league. Although he had a strong surfing, both his forehand and backhand were not so good. The responses were soft and shallow with only a little bit back spin, which gave me a wide angel to hit either inside-in or inside-out.</p>

<p>When I talked with my coach yesterday, he provided some valuable insights about how I should consider the process of a match</p>

<ul>
  <li>Keep the feet floating while preparing ground stroke.</li>
  <li><strong>Volley is the only way to end a point</strong>. No matter how aggressive the ground strokes are, they are not considered to end the point. Instead, they just <em>build</em> the point. If it ends, let it be. If not, that’s the normal case. It means I should always prepare for the next stroke. And the sad part of the story is that after nine months I still don’t really know how to end a point……</li>
  <li>Do not get frustrated playing with players who consistently send lofty backspin. If he voluntarily hands over the control of pace, I should use it wisely: add more topspin on the returns; actively change the angel; don’t rush to end the point but patiently build it.</li>
  <li>Prepare earlier: decide to use forehand or backhand based on the trajectory; once decided, prepare for the ready position; after the bounce, I should begin the movement of hitting; the center of gravity should put into the front halves of the feet, and always keep the momentum forward while hitting the ball.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am glad that I could survive on three-hours sleep per day for almost two weeks. Of course, there were quite a few downsides: I felt very weak after the first several days, and the feeling lasted till the end; I lost 1 and dropped the other 2 times of tennis matches in this period; my Github longest streak of contribution stopped at 200 days, which is the date right before my comprehensive defense…</p>

<p>The things that I completed in return include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A 96-pages thesis for the comprehensive defense</li>
  <li>A collection of decent slides built by Beamer/Latex for defense</li>
  <li>Passed it =D</li>
  <li>A part of one NSF proposal</li>
  <li>One research paper submitted to Globecom’14</li>
  <li>Mid-term II of Game Theory</li>
  <li>One reviewing paper from EuraSip</li>
  <li>The least amount of homework and projects in Coursera that keep me within the schedule</li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, there are lots of lessons to take away from this process. Concerning the defense about research, I find myself still need to adjust the strategy handling problems. In research, it is not about getting thing done, but about how to propose the right question (relevant with the basic/advanced theorems of the related fields) and to make at least some sense out of it.</p>

<p>For the research, I should not pile up most of the work to the last week of the due date, especially when I could anticipate this busy schedule months before. In Jan. and Feb., I did waste plenty of time to try out different algorithms handling the problem, but none of them had the “sky-high” performances, so I just kept trying. Eventually, when the time run out, I chose the “sub-optimal” solution and wrote the paper in a hurry. This should not be the right way. Sometimes, when the theoretical merits are fascinating, I might need to only derive the theorems and formulas with some naive simulations. When the trial and error process has to perform, I should set a “early termination” threshold and record every “best effort” in different scenarios. It will help me leisurely handle the due date, and maybe produce more work/papers.</p>

<p>I hope I won’t have this kind of busy schedule again, in the sense that I have a better planning and complete each work as soon as I can.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It is worth noting that yesterday I had my first win in the 3.0 league=D 7-5, 3-6, and 10-6 in the tie-breaker set. In today’s lesson, Bob told me a bit more about strategic playing. It was all about probing different aspects of the opponent.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Keep hitting in the middle (or either left or right) as long as I can, and see what is the tolerance of the opponent – whether him or me would get frustrated first and try to make some change.</li>
  <li>Consistently push either his backhand or forehand within a point.</li>
  <li>Driving the ball from side to side and observe the pattern of his transition – does he have a high successful rate for the ground stroke while moving? Is his forehand-to-backhand better or worse than the backhand-to-forehand? Does he tend to hit cross court or staight down to the line?</li>
</ul>

<p>The advanced version will also include the timing of pushing towards the net as well as volley, but I haven’t got there yet… I am still struggling to position myself in the transition of volley, let alone the judgement of lobbing or cut-across from my opponent… So, there is a long way to go(:</p>

<p>[Update March 7] The control of my ground stroke is nice, but the hitting point is far from optimal – I should keep the racquet a little bit “closer” and the hitting point should be a little bit in front while the racquet rising in its maximum speed and facing towards the net. Still, The target zone is “higher in the net”.</p>

<p>[Update March 15] The way to increase spin is to make the preparison faster and to prepare the racquet a little bit lower–all movements should be done before the bonuce.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was hoping to find something like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2573135/python-progression-path-from-apprentice-to-guru">Python Progression Path</a> or sort of “best practice” for Emacs, because the difference between Vim and Emacs was much larger than I thought. But what I found were either teaching about basic operations such as saving and quiting the editor for people who had access to comupter for the 1st time, or talking about tricks of using Emacs Lisp for the high-end hard-core players… It seemed like I was stuck in the middle, and would stay there for a very long time…</p>

<p>I will sort the contents here as incremental records simulating my Emacs learning process, as well as keeping track of nontrivial materials and thoughts.</p>

<p>–Well, it is really a road that will never end…</p>

<h3 id="packages">Packages:</h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/magit/magit">Magit</a>. “Magit is the most popular interface to git. If you are new to git and do not need support for other vcs this is likely the package you should try first” – quoted from <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Git">EmacsWiki</a>. The detail explanation can be found from <a href="http://www.masteringemacs.org/articles/2013/12/06/introduction-magit-emacs-mode-git/">Mastering Emacs</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="http://company-mode.github.io/">Company</a> for auto-completion.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="random-thoughts">Random Thoughts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>One of the most fundamental change from Vim to Emacs is that Vim is the most powerful editor in this planet while Emacs is kind of <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?EmacsAsOperatingSystem">“operating system” with a lousy editor</a>. It might be a rant to the right place, but anyway, the other side of the story is that emacs can be regarded as an OS which means that it might be much more powerful when the configuration is right. I should be able to do things that are used to complete via the combination of vim, shell, REPL, and compiler, and I SHOULD NOT launch and exit it very often as what I am doing with vim.</li>
  <li>Everything looks a little bit more decent within the emacs,
including the shell.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="useful-key-combinings">Useful Key Combinings:</h3>

<p>Kill a line:
C-a C-k (move the cursor to the begining of the line, thenkill from the cursor to the end of the line)</p>

<p>Kill 2 lines: C-a C-u 2 C-k</p>

<p>Kill a specific region
C-&lt;SPC&gt; C-w (move around to highlight region, then kill contents within highlight region)</p>

<p>Yank the killed contents C-y</p>

<p>Retrieve yanking history
M-y (right after the 1st yanking. – this is intersting)</p>

<p>The difference between “killing” and “deleting” is that “killed” text
can be reinserted (at any position), whereas “deleted” things cannot
be reinserted in this way (you can, however, undo a deletion–see below).
Reinsertion of killed text is called “yanking”.  Generally, the
commands that can remove a lot of text kill the text (they are set up so
that you can yank the text), while the commands that remove just one
character, or only remove blank lines and spaces, do deletion (so you
cannot yank that text).  &lt;DEL&gt; and C-d do deletion in the simplest
case, with no argument.  When given an argument, they kill instead.
– This is valid for both vim and emacs.</p>

<p>Scoll down the page
C-v (page down)
C-u 8 C-v (scoll down 8 lines)
C-l (move the current line to the middle of the window)
C-u 0 C-l (move the current line to the head of the window)</p>

<p>Getting help
C-h c &lt;Command sequence&gt;   (a very brief description of the command.)
C-h k &lt;Command sequence&gt;   (displays the documentation of the function, as well as its name)</p>

<p>Auto-completion
M-/
<a href="http://company-mode.github.io/">Company</a> is good complementory plug-in</p>

<p>Shell History (also Useful for Haskell REPL)
M-p (or) C-&lt;UP&gt;: Fetch the next earlier old shell command.
M-n (or) C-&lt;DOWN&gt;: Fetch the next later old shell command.
M-r: Begin an incremental regexp search of old shell commands.
C-c C-x: Fetch the next subsequent command from the history.
C-c . : Fetch one argument from an old shell command.
C-c C-l: Display the buffer’s history of shell commands in another window (comint-dynamic-list-input-ring).</p>

<h3 id="missing-features">Missing Features:</h3>

<p>This is a list for what I should expand the functionalities of my Emacs.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Highlight symbol at the point. There is <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/HighlightSymbol">a package</a> for this purpose, but currently it does not work well within Prelude.</li>
  <li>Interactive input for M-x.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>没有想到，这一年能发生这么多的事情。效率从年初开始，越来越高。然后是暑假实习，认识了很多有趣的人，开始打网球。去了波多黎各和维京群岛，看到一生迄今为止最蓝的海。回来后继续打网球，开始瘦身，失散了三十年的六块腹肌和人鱼线都找到了，可年末却把豆豆丢了。痛彻心扉的最后两个月，不太清楚自己是怎么度过的。</p>

<h3 id="statistics">Statistics:</h3>

<p>过去的一年，在学校里修了两门课，GPA还是4.0。发表了三篇文章，还有三篇在等消息，两篇在写，为IEEE Trans. of Signal Processing 和ICC2014 审了两篇论文。此外，在Coursera上完成了6门课，其中收获最大的有Dan Grossman 的Programming Language 以及Tim Roughgarden 的Algorithm Analysis I &amp; II。比较可惜的是Andrew Ng 的 Machine Learning，课程和作业都过半了，但因为自己的论文进度太紧，这门课最终还是没能完成。希望它来年还能再开。</p>

<p>根据豆瓣上的统计，这一年我看完19本书，听了27盘专辑，看了50部电影。其中看过最好看的书是现在还没有读完的巨著SICP…好看的电影包括Argo, The Social Network, Now You See Me, and Star Trek Into Darkness；听歌因为大量使用Douban FM 和Pandora，已经无法具体记录了。另外，完成了2325小时的编程。从九月到年底，用nike running 跑了110 miles，越跑越快，从九月份的7’36”/mi 到十二月的6’47”/mi。体重从78公斤降低到现在的68公斤，腹部和手臂的肌肉都清晰可见了。还有很多东西没有量化，比如网球的一发成功率，主动得分，以及非受迫性失误，等等。</p>

<h3 id="programming">Programming:</h3>

<p>在Coursera上的几门课程对我帮助很大，从熟悉新的编程语言，到高屋建瓴的指导如何实践。这一年新学的语言包括ML, Scala, Ruby, and Haskell，其中前三个都是课程里涉及的。编程时间的积累已经过半，到了5750小时。从简历上，我可以堆出一大坨熟练使用的语言。而对自己而言，进步最大的有两方面。其一，现在可以用很短的时间，甚至是一个下午，去学习一门新的编程语言，其实只用熟悉常用的语法就好，其中的范式和思想都是共通的。其二，对于算法和数据结构的掌握，让我能在更短的时间里将一个具体问题转变成模型。</p>

<p>这一年也花了大量的时间写C++代码，实习里用到了，自己的项目也用到了。但写来写去，依然不喜欢这个语言——繁琐，庞大高效，想做所有的事情却鲜有亮点。用Jobs描述微软的词语来形容C++也是合适的，no taste。使用它，仅仅是因为所处状况暂时没有其他选择而已。在2014年里，计划将实验室的项目逐渐向Haskell过渡，当必须使用OOP的时候，用Scala。至于继续提高的方向，暂时还没想到什么新的语言特别值得学习(maybe Lua, R, or Javascript)，但需要花时间把Compiler看完，然后读完三本2013积攒下来的书：SICP, The Scheme Programming Language，和Real World Haskell。若是此外还有空余，可以旁听一下iOS的课程，重温一下已经放下两年的Obj-C。</p>

<p>因为Haskell的缘故，这几个月越来越多的使用Emacs。发觉一个有关它的笑话大体是对的，Emacs的启动时间都足够用Vim写完一个脚本了。当然，依此类推，启动Eclipse都足够写完一个项目了。。。现在我主要还是是把Emacs当Vim来用，除了C-c C-l来加载Haskell的Compiler，我只不过是在使用Vim里对应的快捷键组合来写程序。我也知道，有关Emacs最吸引人的.el 脚本，我还没有过多涉及。希望在接下来的一年里，我能像使用Vim一样熟练的使用Emacs，有一套自己的加载脚本，多一个得心应手的开发工具。</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The LTE-Advanced introduced by LTE standard release 10 has many new features, including the carrier aggregation, enhanced intercell interferernce coordination (ICIC) for heterogeneous networks (HetNets), enhanced multiple-antenna transmission supporting up to eight downlink layers, and relaying and coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission.</p>

<p>For the carrier aggregation, in order to fully compliant with the IMT-Advanced requirements, the radio-access technology in LTE-Advanced does not only provide entensive support for deployment in spectrum allocations with bandwides ranging from 1 MHz to 20 MHz for backwards compatibility, but also extends by means of carrier aggregation, where multiple component carriers are aggregated and jointly used for transmission to/from a signle terminal. Up to five component carriers, possibly each of different bandwidth, can be aggregated, allowing for transmission bandwidth up to 100 MHz. The component carriers that a UE needs to support are determined through a UE-specific configuration process and a dynamic activation and deactivation process. Due to this activation/deactivation process, the state of SCells can be changed frequently. As a result, <strong>radio link monitoring is only supported in the PCell but not in SCells to avoid complex UE behavior and additional control signaling overhead. Despite this kind of effort, the increased complexity due to physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) decoding and timing tracking of multiple component carriers cannot be avoided</strong>. </p>

<p>The receiver RF filter design depends on the type of carrier aggregation. For the interest of low hardware complexity, a singular RF chain is preferable. But it requires an analog-to-digital converter and RF filter with larger bandwidth. Moreover, due to activation and deactivation of component carriers, there is a retuning issue when a single RF is used for these component carriers. <strong>There should be techniques balancing the packet loss due to RF retuning and the measurement of deactivated SCells to achieve optimal network performance</strong>.</p>

<p>A HetNet consists of low-power picocells and femtocells in addition to high-power macrocells to improve end-users QoS. But this benefit comes at the cost of additional intercell interference between heterogeneous cells, and some of the femtocells might be closed subscriber group, which make the strongest downlink power at the viewpoint of certain UE be the interference. Besides, the commeon reference signal (CRS), synchronization signals, and physical broadcast channel (PBCH) are transmitted in almost blank subframe (ABS), which cause the collision among different Scells. **The interference cancellation should developed based on the release 8/9 which soly considers the macrocell interference management through ABS.</p>

<p>The LTE-Advanced system should fulfill the ITU requirements of the downlink peak spectral efficiency of 30 b/s/Hz. The peak spectral efficiency is the highest achievable data rate per overall cell bandwidth assuming error-free conditions when all available radio resources for the corresponding link direction are assigned to a single UE unit. While two- or four-layer transmission would be more prevalent even for the LTE-Advanced system, the required downlink peak spectral efficiency can only be attained using high-order antenna configurations (i.e., 8 × 8). <strong>The main challenge of high-order multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is computational complexity</strong>. Maximum likelihood (ML) detection is optimal in the sense that it minimizes error probability when the distributions of all data are equally likely. However, due to its high complexity in 8×8 MIMO systems with high modulation order, a direct implementation of ML detection might not be a viable option for such MIMO systems.</p>

<p>The alternatives are zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) detection, but both of them are much worse in performance compared with ML. The k-best detection is another choice, but although its performance is close to ML, its computational complexity is still high to be implemented in the real-world multi-antennas configurations.</p>

<p>In the UE, channel estimation is for feeding back channel state information (CSI) to the base station and equalization of the downlink channel in the process of data demodulation. One of the requirements for LTE-Advanced is that it should support up to eight-layer transmission, which implies that there need to be at least eight transmit antenna ports. Toward this, a key change in the reference signal design philosophy from LTE Release 8 is the separation of the demodulation reference signals (DM-RS) from the channel state information reference signals (CSI-RS) in Release 10. The up-side is saving significant reference signal overhead since it allows the densely populated DM-RS to be UE-specific. The down-side is that in order to provide for eight CSI-RS patterns, the density of CSI-RS in LTE-Advanced is significantly less than that of CRS, that is, there is only one CSI-RS resource element (RE) per RB per antenna port. Besides, CSI-RS is expected to be transmitted only once every five or ten sub-frames. <strong>Advanced algorithms are needed for CSI-RS-based channel estimation and computation of the CSI feedback parameters such as CQI (i.e., modulation and coding rate) because existing methods may incur throughput degradation and/or result in a failure to meet the target BLER requirements.</strong> Possible strategies to improve the CSI-RS channel estimation performance could include exploitation of the time-frequency correlations, the channel’s power delay profile (PDP) and the Doppler shift. </p>
