<div><br /></div>我不想让这样一个词语，成为我永恒的一个论题。但不能否认，我总是会在一些小事上，在这里出现很多问题。譬如说，前一天熬夜看书，第二天白天两门课，中间两个小时的间歇时间我还查阅了近三个月的某本学术期刊，并且下载了两个很不错的工具包，然后呢，晚上想，放松一下吧。于是，实况足球+电视剧，就能耗到零点了。又譬如，上午上课，下午无事，回到宿舍，睡个午觉吧。心里想，一个小时，定个闹钟。结果一觉睡到天黑，并且搞得晚上失眠。坐卧不宁。<div><br /></div><div>像是在写检讨。但这些的确都是恼人并且傻逼的错误。</div><div><br /></div><div>我看得到自己的优点。缺点同样明显。现在我可以比以往任何时候都更加明显的感觉到压力、感觉到环境的优越，以及感觉到自己的不足。</div><div><br /></div><div>博客是一个用来鼓励自己的地方。检讨先。</div></div>

<div><br /></div><div>From http://www.livescience.com/</div>By Jeanna Bryner, LiveScience Senior Writer<br />posted: 12 September 2009 10:54 am ET<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br /><div><br /></div><div><br />Our personalities do more for us than determine our social circles. Temperament can impact a person&#8217;s physical health.<br /><br />&#8220;The idea that behavior or personality traits can influence health is one that&#8217;s been around for a long time. We&#8217;re just now getting a handle on to what extent they do,&#8221; said Stephen Boyle of Duke University Medical Center in North Carolina.<br /><br />From those with a chill demeanor to the completely frazzled types, mental factors are ultimately tied to physical health. And while a highly neurotic person might deteriorate more quickly than others, not every character trait will kill you. Some might even boost lifetimes.<br /><br /><b>No. 7: Cynicism</b><br /><br />Cynics who tend to be suspicious and mistrustful of others, a character trait that scientists refer to as hostility, may have an increased likelihood of developing heart disease. &#8220;These aren&#8217;t necessarily hot-headed people, but people who are more likely to read into people&#8217;s behavior as some hostile motive,&#8221; Boyle said during a telephone interview.<br /><br />In a study of more than 300 Vietnam veterans who were healthy at the study start, Boyle found that those who scored high on measures of hostility were about 25 percent more likely to develop heart disease.<br /><br />Boyle and his colleagues think that hostile individuals might experience more stress, which can cause spikes in an immune-system protein called C3 that has been linked with various diseases, including diabetes. In fact, the participants with higher scores on hostility showed an increase in these proteins while the non-hostile men showed no such increase.<br /><br /><b>No. 6: Lack of meaning</b><br /><br />If you lack a sense of purpose, your stay on Earth could be truncated. A study involving more than 1,200 elderly participants who didn&#8217;t have dementia at the study&#8217;s start found that those who indicated having a high purpose in life were about half as likely to die over the study period, which lasted up to five years. The results, published in the June 15 issue of the journal Psychosomatic Medicine, held regardless of a person&#8217;s age, sex, education and race, along with level of depression and neuroticism.<br /><br />&#8220;Persons with high purpose readily derive meaning from and make sense of the events of their lives, and likely engage in behaviors and activities that they deem important,&#8221; said study researcher Patricia Boyle of the Rush Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease Center in Chicago.<br /><br />Some other research has suggested that people with a higher sense of purpose may have different levels of stress hormones, better heart health or improved immune systems, though more research is needed to firm up any of these biological mechanisms, she said.<br /><br />The opposite also holds: &#8220;The findings from our study suggested that people who no longer set and work actively toward goals or enjoy their day-to-day activities (how they spend their time) are those with greater mortality risk,&#8221; Boyle told LiveScience.<br /><br /><b>No. 5: Fretting</b><br /><br />People who are highly neurotic — constantly worried and anxious, and prone to depression — die sooner on average than their chill counterparts. And a recently reported study of nearly 1,800 men followed over a 30-year period suggests that&#8217;s partly because neurotics are also more likely to smoke. Perhaps having a cigarette eases anxiety, said study researcher Daniel Mroczek of Purdue University in Indiana, adding that such a short-term payoff might not be worth it if it kills you down the line.<br /><br /><b>No. 4: Lack of self-control</b><br /><br />Late for appointments? Can&#8217;t keep your desk organized? No self-control? These seeming benign qualities could take a toll on your health.<br /><br />A review of more than 20 studies and nearly 9,000 participants revealed people who are conscientious — organized, self-disciplined, as opposed to impulsive — live two to four years longer than others. Study researcher Howard S. Friedman of the University of California, Riverside suspects the boost in lifetime can be attributed partly to the fact that highly conscientious individuals are less likely to smoke or drink to excess, and live more stable and less stressful lives. The study is detailed in a 2008 issue of the journal Health Psychology.<br /><br /><b>No. 3: Anxiety</b><br /><br />The jitters can put a strain on your noggin, research suggests. Compared with the highly frazzled, Individuals with a mellow demeanor who are outgoing may be less likely to develop dementia, which can be caused by Alzheimer&#8217;s disease and other illnesses. The claim is based on a study that followed more than 500 elderly individuals for five years. Among the outgoing extroverts, dementia risk was 50 percent lower for participants who were calm compared with those who were prone to distress.<br /><br /><b>No. 2: Gloom and doom</b><br /><br />The gloomy, inhibited person is not just at a disadvantage socially, but also physically.<br /><br />A preliminary study of more than 180 patients suffering from peripheral arterial disease (plaque buildup in the arteries) showed participants with so-called type D, or distressed, personality, had an increased odds of dying sooner than other people. Type-D people are more likely to experience negative emotions while at the same time hold in their feelings.<br /><br />The researchers, who detail their work in the August issue of the journal Archives of Surgery, suggest the personality type is linked with the body&#8217;s immune system as well as stress response system.<br /><br /><b>No. 1: Stress</b><br /><br />Whatever you do, don&#8217;t let this list worry you! Research is showing that prolonged stress can be deadly, and if it doesn&#8217;t do you in, workplace stress can increase your chances of heart disease, flu virus, metabolic syndrome and having high blood pressure.<br /><br />A study of nearly 700 Israeli workers found that those who experienced job burnout (when work stress becomes unmanageable) were nearly twice as likely to develop type 2 diabetes, in which a person&#8217;s body becomes resistant to the sugar-regulating hormone called insulin.<br /><br />And while a job promotion might boost your income, it also stresses you out. British researchers recently found that when people get promoted, they suffer on average about 10 percent more mental strain and are less likely to find time to go to the doctor.</div></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Everybody wants to preach to the young, and tell them to be good and they will be happy. I shall not enter far upon that field, but confine myself to presenting from a business man&#8217;s standpoint of view, a few rules, which, I believe, lie at the root of business success.<br /><br />First&#8211;Never enter a bar-room. Do not drink liquor as a beverage. I will not paint the evil of drunkenness, or the moral crime; but I suggest to you that it is low and common to enter a bar-room, unworthy of any self-respecting man, and sure to fasten upon you a taint which will operate to your disadvantage in life, whether you ever become a drunkard or not.<br /><br />Second&#8211;I wish young men would not use tobacco&#8211;not that it is morally wrong, except in so far as it is used in excess and injures health, which the medical faculty declares it does. But the use of tobacco requires young men to withdraw themselves from the society of women to indulge the habit. I think the absence of women from any assembly tends to lower the tone of that assembly. The habit of smoking tends to carry young men into the society of men whom it is not desirable that they should choose as their intimate associates. The practice of chewing tobacco was once common. Now it is considered offensive. I believe the race is soon to take another step forward, and that the coming man is to consider smoking as offensive as chewing was formally considered. As it is practically abandoned now, so I believe smoking will be.<br /><br />Third&#8211;Having entered upon work, continue in that line of work. Fight it out on that line (except in extreme cases), for it matters little what avenue a young man finds first. Success can be attained in any branch of human labor. There is always room at the top in every pursuit. Concentrate all your thought and energy upon the performance of your duties. Put all your eggs into one basket and then watch that basket, do not scatter your shot. The man who is director in a half dozen railroads and three or four manufacturing companies, or who tries at one and the same time to work a farm, a factory, a line of street cars, a political party and a store, rarely amounts to much. He may be concerned in the management of more than one business enterprise, but they should all be of the one kind, which he understands. The great successes of life are made by concentration.<br /><br />Fourth&#8211;Do not think a man has done his full duty when he has performed the work assigned him. A man will never rise if he does only this. Promotion comes from exceptional work. A man must discover where his employer&#8217;s interests can be served beyond the range of the special work allotted to him; and whenever he sees his employer&#8217;s interests suffer, or wherever the latter&#8217;s interests can be promoted, tell him so. Differ from your employers upon what you think his mistakes. You will never make much of a success if you do not learn the needs and opportunities of your own branch much better than your employer can possibly do. You have been told to &#8220;obey orders if you break owners.&#8221; Do no such foolish thing. If your employer starts upon a course which you think will prove injurious, tell him so, protest, give your reasons, and stand to them unless convinced you are wrong. It is the young man who does this, that capital wants for a partner or for a son-in-law.<br /><br />Fifth&#8211;Whatever your wages are, save a little. Live within your means. The heads of stores, farms, banks, lawyers&#8217; offices, physicians&#8217; offices, insurance companies, mills and factories are not seeking capital; they are seeking brains and business habits. The man who saves a little from his income has given the surest indication of the qualities which every employer is seeking for.<br /><br />Sixth&#8211;Never speculate. Never buy or sell grain or stocks upon a margin. If you have savings, invest them in solid securities, lands or property. The man who gambles upon the exchanges is in the condition of the man who gambles at the gaming table. He rarely, if ever, makes a permanent success. His judgment goes; his faculties are snapped; and his end, as a rule, is nervous prostration after an unworthy and useless life.<br /><br />Seventh&#8211;If you ever enter business for yourself, never indorse for others. It is dishonest. All your resources and all your credit are the sacred property of the men who have trusted you; and until you have surplus cash and owe no man, it is dishonest to give your name as an indorser to others. Give the cash you can spare, if you wish, to help a friend. Your name is too sacred to give.<br /><br />Do not make riches, but usefulness, your first aim; and let your chief pride be that your daily occupation is in the line of progress and development; that your work, in whatever capacity it may be, is useful work, honestly conducted, and as such ennobling to your life.<br /><br />To sum up, do not drink, do not smoke, do not indorse, do not speculate. Concentrate, perform more than your prescribed duties; be strictly honest in word and deed. And may all who read these words be just as happy and prosperous and long lived as I wish them all to be. And let this great fact always cheer them: It is impossible for any one to be cheated out of an honorable career unless he cheats himself.</div>
