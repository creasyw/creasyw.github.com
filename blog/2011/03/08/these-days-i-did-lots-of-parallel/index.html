These days, I did lots of parallel programming. Although sometimes this activity does suffer from low efficiency, it do help me a lot  for further preparing and studying of coding. Like other routine work,  the more both of us prepared, the more efficient work we will have.  Besides, there are several points worth mentioning in retrospect:<br /><br />1) Format matters. Tab is a much better choice than several blanks. <br />2) Comments also matter. It will help others know why I wrote in this manner and what the underlying idea for some blocks of code.<br />3) Multiple screens are necessary: put severl UI in one screen, references in one, and debug windows in one. Cross referring among different dialogs and different screens is one way to improve efficiency. <br />4) As long as employ oneself in the subject, it will be more  straightforward to achieve goals. After all, coding is only  time-consuming in one aspect.<br />5) The use of short-cuts in vim definitely will improve the efficiency, and also seems like more professional:)<br />6) People will only accept suggestions when they know nothing about it. So, at most of the time, the better choice is just keeping quite and getting your own work done. <br />7) Reading more, practice more, improve faster.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />Below is something I read from a <a href="http://jacquesmattheij.com/The+need+to+code">programmer&#8217;s blog</a>.<br /><br /><br />At the time I was a fanatic chess player and my &#8216;dream&#8217; was to  build a  chess program. Of course that was a fairly advanced thing to  do, in the  end my knowledge of computer programming, and my theoretical  knowledge  of chess, the memory of the computer, and the available  time, they all  limited me to writing a program that could do one of two  end games (KQ  vs K and KR vs K). <br />Looking back over all those  years (I&#8217;m 45 now), I don&#8217;t think there  ever was a time when I wasn&#8217;t  programming or thinking about programming  in some way or another since I  gained that first little bit of insight  into what makes a computer  tick.<br /><br />It&#8217;s like a drug. I&#8217;m still fascinated by it, even almost 30  years to  the day later I still read about languages, new ways to solve  old  problems, all kinds of developments in software and hardware, as  though  it is the first time that I hear about these things. It is a  fascinating  world, the world of software. <br />It has changed  tremendously over that time, our &#8216;small&#8217; computers of  today are more  powerful than the biggest &#8216;big iron&#8217; that you could buy  when I was a  kid. Your average cell phone has more storage, computing  power, and  bandwidth available to it than a mainframe of 30 years ago.  Programming  itself has changed, from &#8216;batch&#8217; programming to more and  more  interactive code, &#8216;web&#8217; development and so on. But it has also - in   essence - remained the same, small building blocks are piled on top of   each other to create more complex constructs, which in turn can be used   to create yet more complex constructs, and so on.<br /><br />That process, the act of programming, is something that I <i>need</i>   to do. Whether to make a living or to be fooling around with some  idea,  the bug is in my system and I highly doubt that it will ever  leave me  permanently. I can see myself taking a break, but I can&#8217;t see  myself  ever stopping. All I&#8217;ll end up doing then is to change my mode  from work  to play and eventually that will lead back to some form of  work.<br /><br />If you can&#8217;t program yet, or if you think that it is  &#8216;complex&#8217;, rest  assured, there is nothing that can&#8217;t be learned.  Programming is not like  playing a musical instrument, and it is not  something that you have to  have a genetic disposition for. The pay-off  is in how much time you  spend plugging away at it. Over time you&#8217;ll get  better, and at some  point it will click. It may take a while (it took  me more than a year to  learn &#8216;BASIC&#8217;, which is a very simple language)  and I gave up several  times only to go back to it once more.  Eventually, I got it, and I&#8217;m  sure that everybody that can do basic  arithmetic and that is able to put  together a precise list of  instructions on how to make coffee or a  pizza can learn how to program.<br /><br />Maybe you won&#8217;t be the next Donald Knuth, but that&#8217;s not what it   takes, all you need to be is a little bit better than you were  yesterday  and to keep doing that for a long time.<br /><br />Beware of that bug though, once it bites you, you&#8217;ll be hooked for life.</div>
