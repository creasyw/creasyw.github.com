<div class="entry-content"><p>Sep. 9th. Tennis Club</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dealing with high-bounce top-spin balls, the feet should keep on the ground if possible. More importantly, the racket should be a little bit more open than the regular ground stroke, so that the response won’t hit the net.</li>
  <li>When I am running back, hit the ball higher.</li>
  <li>On the other hand, keep body momentum moving forward while hitting. If time is sufficient, turn body for both forehand and backhand stroke. This is similar to boxing, where the most powerful shot is generated by the whole body, not only just arms and shoulders.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sep. 10th. Private lesson.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Begin serving from the Ad-side.</li>
  <li>Toss the ball 45 degree towards the net.</li>
  <li>Toss higher.</li>
  <li>Bend knees is not just a gesture, but is for pushing the body upwards.</li>
  <li>Relax the wrist as much as I can.</li>
  <li>For practice, try to put two feet close to each other first, and then combine the movement of right foot from the regular position to the left foot.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sep. 13th. Mini-Match vs. Dylan</p>

<ul>
  <li>When I am trying to save the ball from backhand, the racket should fact “largely” to the other side rather than to the sky. Stay relatively at the same height of the touching point and push it, not chop it.</li>
  <li>After serving, instead of observing whether the bounce is valid, quickly retreat behind the base line.</li>
  <li>If there is no time to go back to the most comfortable hitting zone, just prepare early, relax wrist, and swing the racket after the bouncing point. There is a good chance I could still hit an acceptable return.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sep. 16th. Mini-Match vs. Eric.T.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It felt so nice that I am almost (or close to) as competent as one of my coaches one year ago in the very beginner class. Maybe it was because I could not push him to the fullest extent as what he did to me in the match. But, whatever, I had four games ending with multiple deuces, and I did won one of them. One is always a good start:)</li>
  <li>He cared less about the “percentage shoot” than what I did, but he would observe my movements and always tried to hit the open court. This would be my goal in (hopefully) three months.</li>
  <li>My serving is relatively stable now. I need to relax more, both physically and mentally, for both shoulder and wrist; to catch the ball a little bit higher; and to push it more upwards and forwards. Plus right direction of tossing and more practice, I could at least stop bleeding in my serving games.</li>
  <li>There are too many pieces missing from my repository. I am thinking to master back spin as the next step–for defense as well as changing the tempo of the match. After that, I will revisit ground stroke, transition from back court to mid-court, volley/over-head, and then serving again. All of them might take another month and a half. After that, I will seek a re-match with Eric and see how will that go.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sep. 18th. Private lesson and Drill</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learned how to do the backhand back spin:
    <ul>
      <li>To prepare, I should REALLY turn the body sideways. Use the left hand help to hold the racket.</li>
      <li>Prepare the racket a little bit higher. It slightly downwards movement will help to prevent the response floating much.</li>
      <li>The length of swing is longer than what I am used to for the double-handed backhand. So, swing early.</li>
      <li>The contact point is farther away from the body, so I should not over run or need to leave enough room for the swing.</li>
      <li>Relax the shoulder but not turn the waist too much. Meanwhile, lean body towards the net. That is, the majority of the force should be forward rather than to the right side.</li>
      <li>The face of racket should also face mainly towards the net.</li>
      <li>If possible, follow through the racket to the right side to give the ball more side spin.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When I did the volley, I should never jump at the same time.</li>
</ul>
