  <div class="entry-content"><p>Nov. 3rd. Self-Practice w/ ball machine</p>

<ul>
  <li>My backhand slides still feel funny. They could generate either drop shots, or floated baseline rally. Of course, they are inconsistent. But the bigger problem is that I cannot put neither power or spin for the baseline rally. The ideal case is what Djokovic normally does in his match.</li>
  <li>Part of the reason comes from the grip. I should put thumb adjacent to the middle finger so that it fixes to the continental grip. Furthermore, the grip should be solid while the wrist should relax. They are separated parts.</li>
  <li>I could gain more power for serving from the speed of the racket head. That’s a good news:)</li>
  <li>However… the bow-shape body while serving seems a dummy part in my kinetic action. I never really gain any power from that shape. It has something to do with the height of my toss, as well as the timing reaction. Most of my hitting points are too low to put full power or extend the bow-shape body, but as elevating the touching point, it requires better toss and timing. fk</li>
  <li>My toss is still not quite right. I should do more solo practice of tossing with cross lines as reference.</li>
  <li>Volley becomes better and better. I can even add extra backspin while pushing towards the ball, so the returns die really fast.</li>
  <li>But all these goodies happen when I stand still towards the ball machine and have a good anticipation of where the balls will go. If I am moving, it might be a whole new story…</li>
  <li>The caveats remain the same: stop moving and split feet as the opponent hit the ball; keep feet on the ground while hitting; keep racket in front of boy so that I can lean onto it.</li>
  <li><a href="http://youtu.be/-P80QOkHjmc?t=3m25s">You might be bigger. You might be stronger. But you do not outwork me.</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nov. 8th. Tournament @ Lubbock, Texas Tech</p>

<ul>
  <li>1:6, 4:6, 6:5, 6:5. It’s true that the matches themselves are enjoyable, but it becomes fantastic when I win the matches:)</li>
  <li>I definitely should won the first match. The takeaway point is that I should take the process of warming up more seriously. Rather than just hitting round without clear purpose, I should do some slow running, systematic stretching, and a little bit volley, serving, ground strokes, and everything.</li>
  <li>I am glad that I held all but one serving games in the third match, and won the tie-breaker in the end. I even had a Ace! Cheers=D</li>
  <li>I should won the fourth match much easier if I reacted faster and played consistently. My opponent had a lousy backhand and the returns were soft without directional variation. But I didn’t realize it until the score board turned to 5:3, and did not really explore it until the tie-breaker game. Why?! If it was a chess game, I had lost already! My opponents in tournament are faster and stronger than those in the ATC league, but that does not mean the strategic play is useless. I need more thinking and faster reaction!</li>
  <li>Patience does pay off. Keep smiling even if only yourself can feel it. Talk to yourself all the time, to emphasize the strategy, the relax, and the concentration.</li>
  <li>cheers</li>

<time datetime="2014-10-01T09:38:00-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Oct 1<span>st</span>, 2014</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Oct. 1st. Private Lesson</p>

<ul>
  <li>The wrist for my forehand stroke is too tight. That is why I lost my power control. The right manner should relax the wrist in a <em>“controlled”</em> way, so as to gain the directional control as well as the power/spin control.</li>
  <li>It should be cautious to do the inside-out forehand stroke. That is, I have to leave enough time so that my whole body could arrive at the right position and then change my momentum from moving sideway to pushing forward. Or the return ball would sail away. On the contrary, preparing the backhand stroke needs less time, and now I do perform consistent backhand strokes. Hence, using strokes from both hand side no matter whether I am in the due side or ad side.</li>
  <li>I love the drill of “15 mid-court balls”. It’s a combination of cardio, toning, and quick attacking.</li>
  <li>The closer to the net, the shorter swing for the strokes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Oct. 8. Private Lesson</p>

<ul>
  <li>I can barely do the backhand back spin right, and now find that the forehand back spin is even harder. I should use more of my body momentum and fully extend my arm to the direction of returning so as to give the ball more penetration.</li>
  <li>Why do I always forget to split the feet as the opponent hit the ball?!</li>
  <li>The footwork of volley is similar to those of ground strokes–for the forehand side, I should do 2-steps stroke starting from right foot first. This would give me more foreword momentum.</li>
  <li>It is the same for the backhand side. The 1st step starting from the left foot should cut the angle rather than simply moving sideway, so that I could gain more forward power from the body movement.</li>
  <li>My recovering position should be more near the center for the forehand side, and recover much faster for the both sides… It is not hit-and-look-then-recover. Regardless my returns are legal, I should change my position according to my direction of return. This would give me much more time to prepare for the next shot.</li>
  <li>For the duel-side approach shots, it is better not to hit cross court, unless the opponent is far away from that side. Because it requires me to change the direction of moving and run quite a long distance to the left to response the next ball. In the contrary, if I hit down the line, I only need to go on running to the net.</li>
  <li>On the other hand, if the mid-court ball is in the middle between duel and ad sides, I can do whatever is right to deal with it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Oct. 9. Drill at ATC.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I have much better volleys when I keep my feet on the ground and move towards the coming ball. It is a good start to master how to end the point:)</li>
  <li>My ground stroke is off tempo for whatever reason… And I do not turn my body enough to generate the momentum driving the ball.</li>
  <li>I should get a little bit closer to the base line when I recover the position–half feet or one feet behind the base line might be a good distance. Prepare to moving forward at any time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Oct. 10. Gym.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It feels really nice get up at 5:30 and eating breakfast at 8 after hard workout.(:</li>
  <li>The modified version of <em>“bend over row”</em> that I watched in the <a href="http://youtu.be/T0LjSFng_ek?t=1m12s">Chauncey Billups NBA Fit</a> is good. It exercises the core, shoulder, and back muscles.</li>
  <li>When I watched the Shanghai Rolex Masters, I saw Djokovic had the really developed back and shoulder muscles. That might be a focus for my recent workouts.</li>
  <li>I also had a conversation with coach Bob. He prioritized the sections as first for core, second for lower body, and third for the upper body, in which the back and should should come before the chest and arms.</li>
  <li>I won’t do the full HIIT routine recently, but I should revisit it in the winter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Oct. 14. Tennis Club.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Eric pointed out that I had a bad habit of jumping while hitting ground stroke (occasionally?..). This is one of mine long-standing problems…</li>
  <li>Another Eric could sever with great power by taking advantage of “bow shape” of the body.</li>
  <li>In the contrary, most of my power is generated by the shoulder and arm.</li>
  <li>I know how important the body momentum is to drive the ball, as well as how powerful to use the explosive force from lower body and core muscle, and how crucial the back muscle is for balancing. But I need to find a way to fully utilize all of these…</li>
</ul>

<p>Oct. 18. Tournament</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lost all three of the one-set games (3-6, 3-6, 1-6).</li>
  <li>I could not really figure out what to do when I was facing the opponents much stronger than me both physically and technically…</li>
  <li>I should further refine my basic movements. They are fine when I am not fatigue, but become twisted quickly as my power decreasing with the process of the match. And, I do not use the core muscles enough.</li>
</ul>

<p>Oct. 22. Private Lesson</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learned overhead.</li>
  <li>The gists of this movement are: turn the body sideway first; relax the right elbow and do not let it stick to the body; use left hand tracking the trajectory of the ball and move <em>quickly</em> to the back; hitting <em>upwards</em> and forwards</li>
  <li>My volley becomes much smoother thanks to the practice of half-volley backspin.</li>
</ul>

<p>Oct. 21/23. Tennis Club.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I played one-hour extra practice with Winston on both Tue. and Thur.</li>
  <li>It helped me a lot for the forehand ground stroke. I intentionally prepared earlier, turned the body if time permitted, and dropped the head of the racket in a <em>controlled</em> way.</li>
  <li>Based on the observation of the pro players, I need more acceleration from the wrist when I hit the ball.</li>
  <li>My double-handed backhand cannot effectively deal with strong topspin balls. If I cannot retreat back enough to wait the ball drop, I need to further refine the single-handed backspin from backhand. Or, prepare even earlier and hit it before the peak point… That would be tricky..</li>
</ul>

<p>Oct. 29. Private Lesson</p>

<ul>
  <li>I had two-rounds of testing of serving. For the 1st time, I had no double faults, 13 points for control (five 2 points), and 8 points for power (one 2 points). The 2nd time was 2 double faults, 9 points for control (three 2 points) and 10 pints for power (four 2 points).</li>
  <li>The key points of correcting my current severs included: relax wrist to increase the racket speed, toss the ball in 45 degree in front of my right side, and turn shoulder and hips to perform the toss.</li>
  <li>Most of the power comes from the wrist, I have to <em>intensionally</em> make it as relax as possible, and dare to swing it as hard as I can. An indication of a good swing follows by a pop sound.</li>
  <li>Turning the torso provides some extra power as the body catching up the ball in the air. More importantly, it helps to toss in the right direction. Most of my current tosses are spin to the left side.</li>
  <li>Another correction comes from the grip. I <em>always</em> try to change the grip when the racket is preparing behind my head. To git rid of it, the thumb should touch the middle finger, but the hand should settle in the grip rather than squeeze it.</li>
  <li>A minor correction for the forehand volley: the racket should be placed in front of the body and then pushed forward using body movement. It is much natural for the backhand, and that might be why my backhand volley is stabler.</li>
</ul>

<p>Oct. 28/30. Tennis Club</p>

<ul>
  <li>Practice makes perfect, and it is way better to practice with a purpose.</li>
  <li>Keep running. It’s fine for either fast or slow. Regard the 3-hours club as a lesson for <a href="http://www.zhihu.com/question/26441947/answer/32868032">cardio-exercise</a>.</li>
  <li>Both my forehand and backhand rally are more consistent now.</li>
  <li>I know how to response to the mediocre lobs if I do not need to move around a lot. On the other hand, it also tells me that a good lob needs to move the opponent more both sideway and backward, and a little bit more height adds a lot more difficulties.</li>
  <li>I could complete some of the volley and approaching shot. But I should focus more on their techniques and timing in the following free-style practice.</li>
  <li>I should also practice more backhand slides to return the high-bounce backhand attack. It is a good method to neutralize the situation. If I do not have time to properly prepare, I need at least try single-hand response which provides larger covering area and adds more or less backspin.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong><a href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch07_Alone_Time.php">Alone Time</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Set up a rule at work: Make half the day alone time. — A successful alone time period means letting go of communication addiction. During alone time, give up instant messengers, phone calls, and meetings. Avoid any email thread that’s going to require an immediate response. Just shut up and get to work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html">Maker’s Schedule</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When we were working on our own startup, back in the 90s, I evolved another trick for partitioning the day. I used to program from dinner till about 3 am every day, because at night no one could interrupt me. Then I’d sleep till about 11 am, and come in and work until dinner on what I called “business stuff.” I never thought of it in these terms, but <strong>in effect I had two workdays each day</strong>, one on the manager’s schedule and one on the maker’s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000022.html">Human Task Switches Considered Harmful</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Programming is the kind of task where you have to keep a lot of things in your head at once. The more things you remember at once, the more productive you are at programming. A programmer coding at full throttle is keeping zillions of things in their head at once: everything from names of variables, data structures, important APIs, the names of utility functions that they wrote and call a lot, even the name of the subdirectory where they store their source code. <strong>If you send that programmer to Crete for a three week vacation, they will forget it all.</strong> The human brain seems to move it out of short-term RAM and swaps it out onto a backup tape where it takes forever to retrieve.</p>

  <p>In fact, the real lesson from all this is that you should <strong>never let people work on more than one thing at once</strong>. Make sure they know what it is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s not the excuse but the reason that I prefer working in my apartment (or Starbucks) rather than lab, where all kinds of weird situations would come up at any time… Anyway, the takeaway points are: I should pay more attention on my schedule, both for the long term and short term, to maximize the productivity; concentrate on one project (language, research topic) at a given period; extract the most out of it, celebrate, and then dive into another work.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sep. 9th. Tennis Club</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dealing with high-bounce top-spin balls, the feet should keep on the ground if possible. More importantly, the racket should be a little bit more open than the regular ground stroke, so that the response won’t hit the net.</li>
  <li>When I am running back, hit the ball higher.</li>
  <li>On the other hand, keep body momentum moving forward while hitting. If time is sufficient, turn body for both forehand and backhand stroke. This is similar to boxing, where the most powerful shot is generated by the whole body, not only just arms and shoulders.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sep. 10th. Private lesson.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Begin serving from the Ad-side.</li>
  <li>Toss the ball 45 degree towards the net.</li>
  <li>Toss higher.</li>
  <li>Bend knees is not just a gesture, but is for pushing the body upwards.</li>
  <li>Relax the wrist as much as I can.</li>
  <li>For practice, try to put two feet close to each other first, and then combine the movement of right foot from the regular position to the left foot.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sep. 13th. Mini-Match vs. Dylan</p>

<ul>
  <li>When I am trying to save the ball from backhand, the racket should fact “largely” to the other side rather than to the sky. Stay relatively at the same height of the touching point and push it, not chop it.</li>
  <li>After serving, instead of observing whether the bounce is valid, quickly retreat behind the base line.</li>
  <li>If there is no time to go back to the most comfortable hitting zone, just prepare early, relax wrist, and swing the racket after the bouncing point. There is a good chance I could still hit an acceptable return.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sep. 16th. Mini-Match vs. Eric.T.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It felt so nice that I am almost (or close to) as competent as one of the coaching staff one year ago in the very beginner class. Maybe it was because I could not push him to the fullest extent as what he did to me in the match. But, whatever, I had four games ending with multiple deuces, and I did won one of them. One is always a good start:)</li>
  <li>He cared less about the “percentage shoot” than what I did, but he would observe my movements and always tried to hit the open court. This would be my goal in (hopefully) three months.</li>
  <li>My serving is relatively stable now. I need to relax more, both physically and mentally, for both shoulder and wrist; to catch the ball a little bit higher; and to push it more upwards and forwards. Plus right direction of tossing and more practice, I could at least stop bleeding in my serving games.</li>
  <li>There are too many pieces missing from my repository. I am thinking to master back spin as the next step–for defense as well as changing the tempo of the match. After that, I will revisit ground stroke, transition from back court to mid-court, volley/over-head, and then serving again. All of them might take another month and a half. After that, I will seek a re-match with Eric and see how will that go.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sep. 18th. Private lesson and Drill</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learned how to do the backhand back spin:
    <ul>
      <li>To prepare, I should REALLY turn the body sideways. Use the left hand help to hold the racket.</li>
      <li>Prepare the racket a little bit higher. The slightly downwards movement will help to prevent the response floating much.</li>
      <li>The length of swing is longer than what I am used to for the double-handed backhand. So, swing early.</li>
      <li>The contact point is farther away from the body, so I should not over run or need to leave enough room for the swing.</li>
      <li>Relax the shoulder but not turn the waist too much. Meanwhile, lean body towards the net. That is, the majority of the force should be forward rather than to the right side.</li>
      <li>The face of racket should also face mainly towards the net.</li>
      <li>If possible, follow through the racket to the right side to give the ball more side spin.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When I did the volley, I should never jump at the same time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sep. 21th. Match with Reazul.H. (5-6, 7-6)</p>

<ul>
  <li>I’ve lost to this guy three times in a row in the league. So, I am really glad that today’s result could demonstrate my progress.</li>
  <li>His strategy puts defense in the 1st priority, waiting for me to earn the point or to make an unforced error. I have the controlled strokes for the most of the match. That’s great.</li>
  <li>When I can put the 1st serve in, the serving game becomes really easy to keep. In the 2nd set, maybe because of the tired, I have to breath really hard and to exhale out loud while serving. It actually helps me to keep the rhythm right. Of course, other points also hold: relax wrist, toss 45 degree in front of the body, toss high, bend knees and lift the whole body up, touch the ball in the highest point and push it upwards and forwards.</li>
  <li>I have several good drop shots and overhead hits, but those are not consistent. I need to work on it more. Exploring the 2D of the court is always worth trying–for consuming the opponent’s energy and disrupting his typo.</li>
  <li>Back spin by backhand does not work for most of the time…</li>
  <li>I should not retreat way back in the court unless the opponent has really good and strong top spin. Pushing forward is beneficial to enlarge the hitting angle and to put pressure to the other side. This is actually the only way to end a point. However, to achieve it, I need to prepare much earlier and turn sideways to add spin, and do the volley right–follow the route of the return, pause and split before the opponent hits the ball, keep both feet on the ground, and push the ball to the OPEN COURT!</li>
</ul>

<p>Sep. 25. Private lesson. 2-sets Match with Allen (3-6, 6-3)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Double-handed backhand should drive the racket to draw the logo of Nike. This would help me prepare a little bit higher, and have a smoother movement with better topspin. Two caveats are that I should begin the movement <em>earlier</em> since it takes longer time, and make the face of racket <em>less</em> open.</li>
  <li>I used to loose my wrist too much for the forehand ground stroke. I shouldn’t let the head of racket drop that much. Instead, I should use more of my arm/body movements to create the topspin. When I correct my movement, I can feel more of the directional control, but less of the power control–I overhit plenty of balls with the right direction. Maybe I should close more of the face of the racket, or it means that I do not provide enough spin. <em>I need to figure it out</em>.</li>
  <li>For the backhand backspin, I should extend my right arm to follow through the movement and use more of my right shoulder.</li>
  <li>My forehand volley “mysteriously” becomes better. During practice, I could easily drive the ball to either inside-in or inside-out. The backhand could still only do the inside-in. However, that is the practice. I ALWAYS forget to <em>split then react</em> during the match. It might be the reason that I find myself jumping while volley. So, do exactly what you practice for the match!</li>
  <li>The match was tough, and every game might easily go either way. I should figure out a solution during the match much quicker, and drive him running around the court more.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It was better than I expected:)</p>

<p>The main changes came from a few simple suggestions of my coach: keeping patient in rally; making percentage shoots and reducing unforced errors as many as possible; warming up longer than I used to; and balance myself while serving. That was it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I suppose my working out in gym also pays off. Several months ago, I started to divide the strength training to smaller parts as upper/lower/core body, along with cardio exercise. For each part, there are several different approaches to work out. Specifically for tennis, the back and core muscles are more important than those of chest and shoulder for ground strokes. A little bit exercises for the forearm could improve the penetration of serving a lot. Lower muscles are much much more important than I expected–they could provide more explosive strength, let running faster, and more importantly, protect the knee joints. Besides, pilate and stretch are indispensable parts for every workout. These last-30-minutes cooling down process help the body relax and keep up with everyday’s progress.</p>

<p>Of course, I still have plenty of REALLY weak aspects, such as lousy serving, bad backspin and volley, and getting lost in the mid-court…</p>

<p>Anyway, I am happy to get this level:) and wish myself could be the champion one day.</p>

<p>[UPDATE] 09/03/2014. I just saw the greatest match in this year, Murray vs. Djokovic. There are some interesting facts.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Both of them slided their feet together while hitting the serving, but when I did that way, my upper body would become unstable which in turn makes my serving even worse…</li>
  <li>Percentage shoots are the mainstream responses, and they would more inclined to approach to the net when hitting down the line.</li>
  <li>Both of them use lots of backspin for defense, but their movements seemed to have more “chopping” than I did. And if I did that way, the ball would float very high and sail…</li>
  <li>Drop shots are effective means to explore the depth of the court. Making the opponents running is almost always a good strategy to disrupt the tempo as well as actively draining off the energy.</li>
  <li>Mental toughness is the key to win the match.</li>
</ul>

<p>[UPDATE] 09/09/2014. I won’t sign up for any 3.0 League in this year since I’ve began to play the tournament in the university. It has less challenging mentally, but more physically. The strategic play is still useful, but I would also expect longer rally and have more cadio-/HIIT training correspondingly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are two dimensions for a court. I just kept forgetting it! It is always worthwhile to explore both left/right and mid/back of the court. As an amateur like me, the most struggling part might be forced to constantly adjust the tempo. I should keep pushing in this kind of manner more often.</p>

<p>It is almost always a wiser choice to stick to the “percentage shot” for both forehand and backhand. I had too many unforced errors hitting down the line. However, on the other hand, when I stand in the middle of the court, I should be more comfortable to change the direction. For most of the opponents, they would struggle more in their backhands. So I could try more inside-out.</p>

<p>I have a better volley technique, but am still awful in both timing and positioning. I can serve with more power, and a little bit more consistent. The next step will be taking more control in direction. Besides, I need to prepare earlier/higher and hit with looser wrist for the ground stroke. I also need push the momentum forward when I hit the ball. It’s almost one year since I learned this activity, but I still cannot master its most basic part…</p>

<p>Well, anyhow =D</p>

<p>[UPDATE 20/07/2014: I just had a big victory this afternoon: 6-1 and 6-2, against the guy who used to beat me twice. Although it would never be a big deal for winning or losing an amateur game, I still feel really happy for that. I have more control for percentage shot and decrease unforced errors a lot.</p>

<p>Aiming higher in the net also could push opponent further away from the court, then have a better chance receiving a shallow response, and then move into the court, hit down the line, and move forward more for volley – this is a right sequence from building to ending a point. Deep balls with strong top spin would seldom be a good chance to change the direction. Instead, just hit cross court and try to be as deep as I can, meanwhile aiming bouncing towards the baseline rather than the side line.</p>

<p>Maybe it’s really useful to keep thinking both during the match and afterwards, it makes me evolve stronger; or maybe my exercises of lower body and core muscles finally pay out; or maybe my resting and eating schedule give me more energy to do the movements right; or more possibly, my opponent just had a bad day. Well…</p>

<p>I love this game, both mentally and physically(:  ]</p>

<p>[UPDATE 24/07/2014: Lost a game. However, anyway, the take-way points are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Prepare earlier.</li>
  <li>Be patient. Anyone could make mistakes in any time.</li>
  <li>Be relax when serving.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3 id="tennis-and-exercises">Tennis and Exercises</h3>

<p>Until now, I’ve played three matches in this round of 3.0 league, lost twice (6-3, 6-3; and another was 7-5 for two hours and left unfinished), and won once (6-4, 1-6, 10-5). My improvements are quite obvious, but still not big enough for me to turn previous loses towards the same opponents to landslide victories. To the maximum extent, I would not lose a set 4 points straight, but stuck in “deuce…add-in…deuce..add-out…” loops.</p>

<p>These are some aspects I should pay attention to</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do NOT make decisions before hitting the balls. They should depend on how good my response is, as well as the position and momentum of my opponent.</li>
  <li>During the point building, keep percentage shots as long as I can.</li>
  <li>And DISTINGUISH it from capitalizing.</li>
  <li>Do NOT be afraid of volley, and do NOT rush it.</li>
  <li>For current level, attacking the back-hand side is almost always a good choice.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, I don’t have any blank left for any tech. aspect, but almost everything needs to be further improved: adding more top spin for both forehand and backhand ground stroke, being more consistent of back spin in half-volley, splitting timely and positioning myself more appropriate as approaching to the net, and better serving.</p>

<h3 id="trip">Trip</h3>

<p>It was great to see the awesome grand canyon, as well as the horseshoe bend and the antelope valley, and it sucked as I recalled the trip of yellowstone every minute in every day. I thought I had got over of the devastation after seven months. But this trip just proved that I was wrong in a hard way.</p>

<p>I will not rush myself to the conclusion of “feeling well” again, and will not do another trip in the near future.</p>

<h3 id="programming-and-online-courses">Programming and Online Courses</h3>

<p>“Know how to solve every problem that has been solved.” – Richard Feynman</p>

<p>There are many things that I need to prepare before the graduate and really job-hunting. Actually, there are more things in my mind than I could complete. So I should choose wisely.</p>

<p>Currently, I am enrolled in the course “Principle of Computing” offered by Rice University in Coursera. It’s easy in general, but interesting to re-think those small games mathematically with the “programming” point of view. Besides, I also continue reading SICP and solving the problems in each chapter. I also go on reading books for Haskell, and watching a course about artificial intelligent in edX. Combining with what I have learned in machine learning and algorithm, I should have a better grasp about what to do and how to do in this field of study. On the other hand, I’ve also dropped off several courses for too much overlapping with what I have already known, or for tedious pedagogy and far-fetched implementations.</p>

<p>I have extensively used Emacs for this summer. Sometimes, I even appreciate its methodology more than I do for Vim, though I would still prefer Vim for 90% of occasions. After tried and failed several times to customize it from scratch, I started beginning with Prelude, and then piling other stuff on it. Despite in favor of most its adds-on, I disable the Viper mode. The logic behind is that if I want to use a Vim, I will use the Vim. Before I fully appreciate its advantages and disadvantages, I would like to keep Emacs as it is. Currently, I use Haskell and Racket in it. It does do a better job than Vim for Haskell, and DrRacket for Racket. Besides, I have tried twice of adopting R in current work, but still cannot find a scenario exclusively using it. It’s not really good at modeling (LISP or Haskell), visualization (matplotlib in Python, JavaScript, or Mathematica), computational efficiency (C++, or Haskell), or just for fun (LISP, ML, or Ruby). Given it is THE favorite language of some of my very smart friends, I will give it another try whenever possible.</p>

<h3 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>

<p>Doing some experiments on myself is fun and worthwhile. For example, I have tried several days to go to bed earlier than I usually do. My feeling is more or less the same as what said in <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/06/27/sleep-as-a-competitive-advantage/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=1&amp;">“Sleep as a Competitive Advantage”</a>, and I will stick to it.</p>

<p>Because I need to toss the tennis ball better, I use my left hand as often as I can, such as drawing diagrams or doing all kinds of doodle/calculations. It’s too soon to tell if I have any progress. I am also trying different ways to brew coffee. Pour-over versus press pot seems like another version of Emacs versus Vim.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><ul>
  <li>The ability to visualize the consequences of the actions under consideration is crucial to becoming an expert programmer.</li>
  <li>Procedures that manipulate procedures, including accept them as arguments or return them as values, are called <em>higher-order procedures</em>. (The <em>sigma</em> summation and the derivative operation are all good/simple examples for the latter case.) This is one of the basic characteristics of <em>factional programming languages</em>.</li>
  <li>The significance of higher-order procedures is that they enable us to represent these abstractions explicitly as elements in our programming language, so that they can be handled just like other computational elements……As programmers, we should be alert to opportunities to identify the underlying abstractions in our programs and to build upon them and generalize them to create more powerful abstractions……It poses challenges for efficient implementation, but the resulting gain in expressive power is enormous.</li>
  <li>As with compound procedures, the main issue is to be addressed is that of abstraction as a technique for coping with complexity, while the data abstraction enables us to erect suitable <em>abstraction barriers</em> between different parts of a program.</li>
  <li>In general, the underlying idea of data abstraction is to identify for each type of data object a basic set of operations in terms of which all manipulations of data objects of that type will be expressed, and then to use only those operations in manipulating the data.</li>
  <li>The approach of <em>stratified design</em> is the notion that a complex system should be structured as a sequence of levels that are described using a sequence of languages. Each level is constructed by combining parts that are regarded as primitive at that level, and the parts constructed at each level are used as primitives at the next level. The language used at each level of a stratified design has primitives, means of combinations, and means of abstraction appropriate to that level of detail.</li>
  <li>(Thoughts) I thought local binding with “let/let*/letrec” are similar to what I did in the imperative programming in a sense that I was telling the program what to do. However, this is not the essence. The local binding is the part of paper which contains the “where…” after a complicated formula. It is the way for data abstract.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><ul>
  <li>Ideally, every time hitting the ball should be a “kinetic chain of reactions”– the momentum moves from feet to knee, to waist, to shoulder, and finally to the forearm and wrist.</li>
  <li>If I only use part of the chain, I might still hit a good ball, occasionally. But it would consume more energy, and the hitting would be much more unstable.</li>
  <li>Technically speaking, serve is the only way that I can completely control this kinetic chain, because I can control all of the paces and do not need to move around.</li>
  <li>During a point, whenever opponent hits the ball, I should pause and split feet, no matter where I am in the court. This could help me make judgment. More importantly, it is the way to “load energy” and start the “kinetic chain”.</li>
  <li>I have too many aspects to improve, but this might be the most important one.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last Thursday, I had another win in the league(: In my point of view, I was pretty lucky for the previous victories, but I did have an overwhelming victory this time. I was much better than one month ago (yeah! of course=P), and the opponent was a sub-player, who was weaker than others in the league. Although he had a strong surfing, both his forehand and backhand were not so good. The responses were soft and shallow with only a little bit back spin, which gave me a wide angel to hit either inside-in or inside-out.</p>

<p>When I talked with my coach yesterday, he provided some valuable insights about how I should consider the process of a match</p>

<ul>
  <li>Keep the feet floating while preparing ground stroke.</li>
  <li><strong>Volley is the only way to end a point</strong>. No matter how aggressive the ground strokes are, they are not considered to end the point. Instead, they just <em>build</em> the point. If it ends, let it be. If not, that’s the normal case. It means I should always prepare for the next stroke. And the sad part of the story is that after nine months I still don’t really know how to end a point……</li>
  <li>Do not get frustrated playing with players who consistently send lofty backspin. If he voluntarily hands over the control of pace, I should use it wisely: add more topspin on the returns; actively change the angel; don’t rush to end the point but patiently build it.</li>
  <li>Prepare earlier: decide to use forehand or backhand based on the trajectory; once decided, prepare for the ready position; after the bounce, I should begin the movement of hitting; the center of gravity should put into the front halves of the feet, and always keep the momentum forward while hitting the ball.</li>
</ul>
