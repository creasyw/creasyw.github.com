1. Live Monitoring and Writing Raw 802.11 Packets — From madwifi README<br /><br />The driver can be used in a live “monitor” mode, by creating a monitor<br />VAP and sending packets to it. All packets sent to a monitor mode VAP<br />will bypass any state machine.<br /><br />To create a monitor VAP, use:<br /><br />wlanconfig ath1 create wlandev wifi0 wlanmode monitor<br />ifconfig ath1 up<br /><br />Finally, you can choose to receive packets on ath1 in several different<br />packet formats:<br /><br />echo ’801′ &gt; /proc/sys/net/ath1/dev_type # only 802.11 headers<br />echo ’802′ &gt; /proc/sys/net/ath1/dev_type # prism2 headers<br />echo ’803′ &gt; /proc/sys/net/ath1/dev_type # radiotap headers<br />echo ’804′ &gt; /proc/sys/net/ath1/dev_type # atheros descriptors<br /><br />2. Disable CRC and PHY error checking<br /><br />Allows monitor VAPs to process frames that have been marked<br />as errors by the hardware. Two new sysctl entries are created,<br />“monitor_crc_errors” and “monitor_phy_errors”. When these are set<br />to 1, the monitor mode interface will pass through frames that have<br />been marked with HAL_RXERR_CRC and HAL_RXERR_PHY respectively.<br />Default is to maintain current behaviour – no rx errors are passed<br />through.<br /><br />echo ’1′ &gt; /proc/sys/net/ath1/monitor_crc_errors # Disable CRC error checking<br /><br />echo ’1′ &gt; /proc/sys/net/ath1/monitor_phy_errors # Disable PHY error checking</div>

64位的系统，才知道自己的浏览器是32位的……谢谢国家，谢谢oracle，谢谢java installer。折腾了半天的64位eclipse，修了这个错修那个错，就如同这个帖子一样（<a href="http://www.satya-weblog.com/2010/07/eclipse-error-failed-to-load-the-jni-shared-library-cprogram-files-x86javajre6binclientjvm-dll.html">here</a>）。是下面的一个回复帮了我～<br /><br />Nietvoordekat: &#8220;I have a 64 bit Windows 7, didn&#8217;t check if I had the 32 or 64 bit Java installed. Easy and fast check to do, is whether or not your Java folder is in Program Files or Program Files(x86). If you&#8217;ve got both of these maps and it&#8217;s in the x86 one, you&#8217;ll need the 32 bit download. You might wanna move that tip up from the bottom to the top, it shouldn&#8217;t take more then 10 secs to check.&#8221;</div>

Fix Wireless Ad-Hoc in GUI [<a href="http://www.ubuntugeek.com/creating-an-adhoc-host-with-ubuntu.html">click</a>]<br /><br /><br />Wireless Extensions CLI tools<br />This process is often used as the fall back position if the gui tools fail to work. The following example uses eth1 for the wifi interface though this may be wlan0, ath0 or something else in your case.<br /><br />Preparation:<br />Ensure that network manager has been stopped and then bring the interface down.<br /><b>sudo service network-manager stop</b><br /><b>sudo ifconfig eth1 down</b><br /><b>iwconfig (or ifconfig)</b> //look up if there is anything abnormal<br /><b>sudo dhclient eth1</b> &nbsp;////Bring the interface back up<br /><br />Configuration:<br /><b>sudo iwconfig eth1 mode ad-hoc</b> &nbsp;//Switch the card into ad hoc mode<br /><b>*sudo iwconfig eth1 channel 4</b> &nbsp;//Set the channel/frequency that you want to use.<br /><b>sudo iwconfig eth1 essid &#8216;name&#8217;</b> &nbsp;//Add the name (ssid) for the network you want to create/join. Use single quotes if there is a space in the name.<br /><b>*sudo iwconfig eth1 key 1234567890</b> &nbsp;//Add a WEP encryption key<br /><b>*sudo dhclient eth1</b> &nbsp;//Start dhclient to get an address<br /><b>sudo ifconfig eth1 169.254.34.2 </b>&nbsp;//If you want to do it manually, you will have to make up an IP address.<br /><br />You should now be connected to the ad hoc network. Use the iwconfig command to view the cell being used. This must match the same cell on the other PCs that you want to connect to.<br /><br />Testing:<br /><b>ping 169.254.34.2</b> &nbsp;//Once you have two or more computers connected to the ad hoc network, all of them showing the same cell number and having different IP addresses, then try pinging one from the others. If that doesn&#8217;t work then try specifying the interface name along with the address.<br /><b>ping -I eth1 169.254.34.2</b> &nbsp;//If you have more than one interface with link-local addresses there can be some routing confusion, so I recommend that you bring down these unused interfaces while connected to non-DHCP networks. If the other interfaces are all on DHCP networks, such as in the case of InternetConnectionSharing this is not necessary.<br />sudo ifdown eth0<br /><br />Example Interfaces File:<br />Currently Network Manager does not support static address settings and Network-Admin does not support ad hoc networks. So instead we can configure the network in the /etc/network/interfaces file. The following is an example.<br /><br />auto lo<br />iface lo inet loopback<br /><br />auto eth1<br />iface eth1 inet static<br />wireless-mode ad-hoc<br />wireless-channel 4<br />wireless-essid &#8216;name&#8217;<br />wireless-key 1234567890<br />address 192.168.0.2<br />netmask 255.255.255.0<br />gateway 192.168.0.1<br /><br /><br /><br />ps. some useful command:<br />ifconfig [<a href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/linux_network/x-087-2-iface.ifconfig.html">click</a>] &nbsp;iwconfig [<a href="http://gd.tuwien.ac.at/linuxcommand.org/man_pages/iwconfig8.html">click</a>]<br />wlanconfig [<a href="http://linux.die.net/man/8/wlanconfig">click</a>] &nbsp;tcpdump [<a href="http://www.tcpdump.org/tcpdump_man.html">click</a>]</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
In telecommunications, received signal strength indicator (RSSI) is a measurement of the power present in a received radio signal. RSSI is generic radio receiver technology metric, which is usually invisible to the user of device containing the receiver, but is directly known to users of wireless networking of IEEE 802.11 protocol family. RSSI is often done in the intermediate frequency (IF) stage before the IF amplifier. In zero-IF systems, it is done in the baseband signal chain, before the baseband amplifier. RSSI output is often a DC analog level. It can also be sampled by an internal ADC and the resulting codes available directly or via peripheral or internal processor bus.<br /><br />&#8220;RSSI&#8221; values have unspecified unit, ie. their meaning depends on manufacturer. Some report as dBm, some as a percent, some even in milliwatts. There is no standard. Also, the proper way to find SNR *is* to subtract dB values, as dB are logarithmic and hence the difference of logs is the same as a ratio without log. In other words, if a signal has amplitude 1 and noise is 0.5, the SNR is (1/0.5) = 2, but if the signal is measured as being at (say) -12 dB and noise floor is -16 dB, the SNR is (-12-(-16)) = 4 dB.<br /><br />Moreover, link quality depends on many other factors and the signal-to-noise ratio (computed from rssi and noise floor) is only one such factor.<br /><br />And finally, finding SNR of a wifi signal by subtracting noise floor from the rssi is of course only applicable if both values are reported in a log/dB scale. Otherwise if they are linear you&#8217;d need to use ratio (as you said) and if they are some other sort of scale then who knows what needs to be used!</div>

<div class="Section1"><h1 align="center" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The Computer Sciences Department Rules to Live By</span></h1><div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">November 2, 2008</span></div><span style="font-family: Arial;">The Computer Sciences Department is a community of scholars and students. Each of us thrives if the community thrives. Each of us thus has an individual responsibility to strive, not just for our own goals, but for the goals of the larger community. In this document, <span class="GramE">a group of the faculty have</span> laid out a set of ground rules designed to make our department the kind of community in which we all want to live. If a professor in one of your classes has pointed you here, you should view this document as part of the syllabus for that class. </span><br /><h2><span style="font-family: Arial;">As a Student, What You Can Expect from Your Department</span></h2><h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">I. The CS Curriculum</span></h3><ul type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The <span class="GramE">faculty as a whole have</span> the      responsibility to formulate a curriculum that will prepare you for a      lifetime of work in the field of computing. Yes, some of what you learn      will get you a job right away. Some of what you learn may seem more      esoteric and less essential. But remember that the <span class="GramE">faculty      have</span> lived through a lot of changes in the field. They&#8217;ve all had      to learn new ideas, new programming language, new architectures, and new      applications many times (and without the aid of classes or textbooks).      They&#8217;ve got a lot of first hand understanding of the fundamental concepts      that make it easiest to adapt as new things come along. Trust a bit and      take advantage of this expertise. Try to like every class you take. </span></li></ul><h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">II. Each Class that You Take</span></h3><ul type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The most important thing that each of your teachers should give you      is a guided tour through the subject matter of the class. After all, you      can go to the bookstore, buy books, read them, and write some code without      ever signing up for a class. But, whenever you do sign up for a class, you      have the right to expect that the instructor has read a lot of books,      solved a lot of problems, and then chosen, from all of that material, 14      weeks of the most important ideas presented in the clearest fashion. </span></li><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">You have the right to expect that every instructor will show up for      class on time and be prepared to conduct the class. </span></li></ul><h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">III. Responsiveness from the Instructional Staff</span></h3><ul type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In most of your CS classes, you will have an instructor, one or      more TAs, and possibly a set of proctors. <span class="GramE">This group of      people, working as a team, have</span> the responsibility to do everything      they can to help you learn. </span></li><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Your instructor, TAs, and proctors should treat you with respect      and encourage you to seek help when you need it. </span></li></ul><h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">IV. Grades</span></h3><ul type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Publication of the Grading Policy: You have a right to be told, within      the first four days of the semester, how grades in each class will be      determined. You will be told what the basis of the grade will be and how      much weight will be assigned to each component of the grade. In some      classes, you may be told even more, for example, what numeric scores will      be assigned what letter <span class="GramE">grades.</span> But keep in mind      that this isn&#8217;t always possible. Classes that use different exams each      semester may have very different score distributions from one semester to      the next so it isn&#8217;t possible to know in advance what thresholds make      sense. </span></li><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Fairness: You have a right to expect that grades will be assigned      fairly. Every student who turns in the same quality of work will receive      the same grade. </span></li><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Feedback: You have a right to see your graded work and to      understand what, if <span class="GramE">anything,</span> was wrong with the      work you submitted. </span></li><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Punctuality: You have a right to expect that exams and assignments      will be graded in a timely fashion. It&#8217;s hard to be more specific on this      since the amount of time required to do a good job of grading depends so      heavily on the kind of work and the staffing level of the class. One      concrete thing you should expect is that you will have gotten some      substantive feedback on your performance in each class before the Q drop      deadline. </span></li></ul><h2><span style="font-family: Arial;">As a Student, What the Department Can Expect from You</span></h2><h3><a href="" name="honesty"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I. Academic Honesty</span></a></h3><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The University and the Department are committed to preserving the reputation of your degree. It means a lot to you. In order to guarantee that every degree means what it says it means, we must enforce a strict policy that guarantees that the work that you turn in is your own and that the grades you receive measure your personal achievements in your classes: </span></div><span style="font-family: Arial;">Every piece of work that you turn in with your name on it must be yours and yours alone unless explicitly allowed by an instructor in a particular class. Specifically, unless otherwise authorized by an instructor: </span><br /><ul type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Students may not discuss their      work with anyone except the instructor and other members of the      instructional staff (TA, Section Leader or Lab Proctor). </span></li><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Students may not acquire from any      source (e.g., another student or an internet site) a partial or complete      solution to a problem or project that has been assigned. </span></li></ul><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">You are responsible for complying with this policy in two ways: </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">1.<span style="font: normal normal normal 7pt/normal 'Times New Roman';">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;">You must not turn in work that is not yours, except as expressly permitted by the instructor of each course. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">2.<span style="font: normal normal normal 7pt/normal 'Times New Roman';">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;">You must take all reasonable precautions to prevent your work from being stolen.&nbsp; It is important that you do nothing that would enable someone else to turn in work that is not theirs.&nbsp; Do not share your work with anyone else.&nbsp; Make sure that you adequately protect all your files.&nbsp; Even after you have finished a class, do not share your work or published answers with the students who come after you.&nbsp; They need to do their work on their own.</span></div><i><span style="font-family: Arial;">IMPORTANT: The penalty for academic dishonesty will be a course grade of F and a referral of the case to the Dean of Students Office. Further penalties, including suspension or expulsion from the University may be imposed by that office.</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial;">One final word: This policy is not intended to discourage students from learning from each other, nor is it unmindful of the fact that most significant work in computer science and in the computing industry is done by teams of people working together. But, because of our need to assign individual grades, we are forced to impose an otherwise artificial requirement for individual work. In some classes, it is possible to allow and even encourage collaboration in ways that do not interfere with the instructor&#8217;s ability to assign grades. In these cases, your instructor will make clear to you exactly what kinds of collaboration are allowed for that class. </span><br /><h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">II. Attendance at Classes and Exams</span></h3><ul type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Specific policies on class      attendance will be set by individual instructors. Make sure you follow      those policies. </span></li><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Whether you come to class or not,      you are responsible for keeping up with what happens in class. If you miss      a class (other than for illness or an emergency), it is not reasonable for      you to expect your instructor or TA to repeat just for you the material      that was covered in the class that you missed. This applies both to the      content of the class as well as to announcements about class policies,      events, deadlines, or whatever. </span></li><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Final examination schedules are      published at the time of <span class="SpellE">preregistration</span>. If you      are making end-of-semester travel plans, make sure that you will still be      here to take each of your finals at the scheduled time. Travel plans are      not a valid reason for missing an exam or asking for a special exam time. </span></li><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The policy on makeup exams will      be set by individual instructors. Sometimes a makeup will be allowed, but      many times it will not be. Except for emergencies, you must take each exam      at its scheduled time unless you have made prior arrangements with the      instructor. Keep in mind that is often difficult or impossible for an      instructor to create a separate makeup exam that is guaranteed to be of      equal difficulty as the regular exam. </span></li><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Demands of a job or job      interviewing are never valid reasons for missing a class (or a deadline or      an exam). </span></li></ul><h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">III. Classroom Behavior</span></h3><ul type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">You have the right to learn in      every class you attend. But you have the responsibility to help assure      that every other student shares that right. Specifically: </span></li> <ul type="circle"><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Come to       class on time. Do not leave early. These things are very disruptive.       Recognize that the buses and the parking space situation are       unpredictable elements and allow for that. If you must come late or leave       early (for example because of a doctor&#8217;s appointment), let the instructor       know in advance. </span></li><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Don&#8217;t be       disruptive during class. Don&#8217;t chat with your neighbor or rustle the       newspaper. </span></li><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Don&#8217;t allow your       electronic devices to be disruptive. Turn off your cell phone, beeper,       and watch alarm. </span></li><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Participate.       </span></li></ul></ul><h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">IV. Academic Work outside the Classroom</span></h3><ul type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The only way to learn computer      science is to do it. You should plan to spend a substantial amount of time      outside the classroom working on each class that you take. For some      classes, that will mean programming. For others, it may mean reading,      studying, working problems, writing, or whatever. Don&#8217;t let this work      slide. It will not generally possible either to do a programming project      or learn the material in a theoretical class the night before the due date      or the exam. You should be working on your own every week of the semester.      </span></li><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">A deadline is a deadline. Each      instructor will publish the class policy for turning in late work. Plan      your work accordingly. Don&#8217;t push the deadlines and don&#8217;t expect the      instructor to do anything other than what has been published. Even five      minutes is &#8220;late&#8221;. Your instructor can&#8217;t just acquiesce and accept your      project five minutes late. Then what about seven or ten or fifteen or      thirty? What about the other students in the class who had to miss some      other event in order to get their work in on time? Is it fair to them to      accept your work late? No. Plan that the printer will be down and the      busses will be late on the day your assignment is due. Don&#8217;t cut it down      to the wire. And, if you do, accept the published consequences with grace.      </span></li></ul><h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">V. Faculty and Staff Interaction</span></h3><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Your instructor, plus any TAs and/or proctors assigned to your class will work as a team to help you learn. But you need to interact with them in a reasonable way. Specifically: </span></div><ul type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Remember that the instructional <span class="GramE">staff are</span> a team. They will not all do everything. The      instructor will tell you who will be responsible for what. Respect that.      If you ask the wrong person your question, you probably won&#8217;t get a      reasonable answer and you will waste their time as well as yours. For many      kinds of questions it really is better to ask the TAs or the proctors.      This is particularly true of <span class="SpellE">nitty</span> gritty      questions that arise in the labs, since the TAs and proctors are likely to      spend more time there than the instructor does. It&#8217;s their job. </span></li><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Email: </span></li> <ul type="circle"><li class="MsoNormal">  <span style="font-family: Arial;">The       University&#8217;s </span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><a href="http://www.utexas.edu/its/policies/emailnotify.html">electronic       mail policy</a> recognizes email as an effective way for your instructor       and TAs to inform you about important things that may be happening in       class. You are responsible for: </span></li> <ul type="square"><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Making sure that your instructor has a valid        email address for you. If you do not want to use the one that the        university has on record, then make sure to give your instructor another        one. </span></li><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Reading your email every day. </span></li><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Guaranteeing that your mailbox does not        overflow. </span></li></ul></ul></ul><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Excuses such as, &#8220;My email box was full&#8221;, &#8220;I don&#8217;t use that email address any more&#8221;, &#8220;I was too busy to check my email&#8221;, &#8220;I was on an interview trip and couldn&#8217;t check my email&#8221;, or &#8220;My computer crashed and all of my email was destroyed&#8221; aren&#8217;t acceptable. </span></div><ul type="disc"><ul type="circle"><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Email is also a very valuable way for you to       communicate with your instructor and <span class="GramE">TAs.</span> But be       sure you use it appropriately. Specifically: </span></li> <ul type="square"><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Using email, it&#8217;s easy to ask a question or        make a comment that you&#8217;d never make in person. Be careful about this.        If you think that what you&#8217;re about to say wouldn&#8217;t be something you&#8217;d        feel comfortable going to office hours to say, you probably shouldn&#8217;t        say it in email either. </span></li><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In particular, do not send email to your        instructor (or anyone else for that matter) when you&#8217;re angry. You&#8217;ll        regret it when you calm down and you&#8217;ll have antagonized someone who is        important to you. </span></li><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Remember that the instructor has a permanent        record of every email message. </span></li><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Feel free to use email to ask questions about        projects and homework assignments. But keep in mind that, although email        is available, <span class="GramE">neither the instructors or</span> the        TAs are responsible for replying to email the instant it is sent. Don&#8217;t        wait until the last minute before something is due to ask your        questions. Also, keep in mind that, if you ask a question that has a        nontrivial answer, it may not make sense for the instructor or TA to        write a small book for you. Sometimes it will be reasonable for them to        ask you either to bring the question to class or to come to office hours        to discuss it. </span></li><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Although it&#8217;s easy for you to dash off an email        question, it takes time for the instructor or the TA to answer it. Don&#8217;t        ask questions to which you can find the answer somewhere else. For        example, don&#8217;t write to your instructor to ask where the regularly        scheduled final exam is. (It&#8217;s on the Registrar&#8217;s web site.) Don&#8217;t write        and ask how much the first midterm counts. (It should be on the class        syllabus.) Don&#8217;t ask what happened in a class that you missed (unless        you had an emergency). </span></li></ul></ul><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Office hours are there for you to use. You can expect that the      person who is teaching your class loves the material and wants to share it      with anyone who will listen. If you have questions about what&#8217;s been      covered in class or you&#8217;re interested in finding out more about something,      go to office hours and ask. You&#8217;ll probably find that it&#8217;s hard to get the      faculty to shut up. The one thing that most <span class="GramE">faculty</span>      hate is students who only come to office hours to ask questions about      grades. If there&#8217;s been a mistake in grading your work, of course, go and      ask (see below). But think twice before you go to office hours to ask      questions that give the impression that you care less about learning than      you do about grades. A few other points to keep in mind about office      hours: </span></li> <ul type="circle"><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">If you can&#8217;t make it to regularly scheduled       office hours, ask for an appointment. But don&#8217;t leave this to the day       before the exam. It may not be possible to find a suitable time on such       short notice. </span></li><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Again, remember the team concept. The faculty       and TAs for your class will try to schedule their office hours to cover       as wide a range of times as possible. If you can&#8217;t make it to one       person&#8217;s office hours, try someone else. </span></li><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Unless an office door is already open, knock       first and don&#8217;t go in until you&#8217;re invited to do so. </span></li></ul></ul><h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">VI. Grades</span></h3><ul type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Grades are a necessary evil. You don&#8217;t like worrying about grades      and the faculty hate having to assign them. We&#8217;d all rather focus on the      content of our classes. But your degree is a commitment from the      University that you have achieved a certain level of expertise in the      classes you&#8217;ve taken, so we need some way to measure that. To make this      process work, you need to understand: </span></li><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The grade you are given, either on an individual exam or assignment      or as your final grade, is not the starting point of a negotiation. It is      your grade unless a concrete error has been made. Do not go to see your      instructor or your TA to ask for a better grade because you want one or      you &#8220;feel you deserve it&#8221;. Go only if you can document a specific error in      grading or in recording your scores. </span></li><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Your grade is a reflection of only one thing: how well did you do      in the class. Nonacademic circumstances have no bearing on your grade.      Don&#8217;t go to see your instructor and explain how important a better grade      is in your life. It would be unfair to other students and it would      undermine the meaning of the degree if the instructor responded to such      issues. </span></li><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">If you believe that an error has been made in grading your work,      you have one week from the time that the work was returned to the class to      file a complaint in writing to your instructor. Note that this is one week      from the time that the instructor made the work available to the class. If      you missed class and didn&#8217;t get your work until later, there is no      extension of the one week deadline. If you decide to submit a complaint      about the grading of your work, make sure to describe the issue clearly      and return the original work and your note to your instructor. </span></li><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Errors can certainly be made in grading. But keep in mind that the      errors can be made either in your favor or not. So it&#8217;s possible that if      you ask to have a piece of work <span class="SpellE">regraded</span> your      grade will go down rather than up. </span></li><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Remember that the most important characteristic of any grading      scheme is that it be scrupulously fair to everyone in the class. Keep this      in mind if you&#8217;re thinking of asking, for example, for more partial credit      points on a problem. The important thing is not the exact number of points      that were taken off for each kind of mistake. The important thing is that      that number was the same for everyone. So it can&#8217;t be changed once the      grading is done and the papers have been returned. </span></li><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">You instructor will decide what it takes to get an A or a B or a C      or D in the class. Deciding the boundary cases is always hard. Your      instructor is under no obligation to make score cutoffs public or to tell      you how far away <span class="GramE">your were</span> from the next higher      grade. </span></li></ul></div></div>

<span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">The rate selection of the driver is working as follow: firstly, identify the initial link speed with the FUNCTION &#8220;MlmeUpdateTxRates&#8221; in mlme.c, then set the transmition rate with FUNCTION &#8220;SetCommonHT&#8221; in cmm_info.c. Specifically the FUNCTION &#8220;RTMPSetDesiredRates&#8221; in \common\cmm_info.c is to set 802.11a/b/g data rate; and FUNCTION &#8220;RTMPSetHT&#8221;, &#8220;RTMPSetIndividualHT&#8221;, and &#8220;RTMPUpdateHTIE&#8221; in the same file are to set the 802.11n data rate, where set its value according to desired rate according to input parameter and bandwidth.</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br /></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br /></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">The FUNCTION &#8220;MlmeUpdateHtTxRates&#8221; in \include\mlme.c is to update the data rate used in 802.11n scenario. The update decision is made based on the desired PHY layer infromation saved in a struct, the updated channel parameters provided by FUNCTION &#8220;RTMPCheckHt&#8221; in the same file, and more importantly, the calculation provided by FUNCITON &#8220;MlmeSelectTxRateTable&#8221;. The three function mentioned about communication with each other mainly via the array MCSSet[16], whose definition is in file \include\mlme.h.</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br /></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br /></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Furthermore, your advice about the rate selection range help me find the definition of high throughput in file \include\rtmp_def.h, where has two groups of transition rate: 0 to 7 (6Mbps to 54Mbps) for OFDM, and 0 to 33 (MCS_0 to MCS_32, and MCS_33 is auto-rate). As long as the dongle we chose have two transmission antennas, we can use MCS_0 to MCS_15, corresponding&nbsp; up to 300Mbps. This can be set in file \common\cmm_profile.c, triggered by key words &#8220;FixedTxMode&#8221; or &#8220;HT_TxStream&#8221;. However, because the algorithm will check the status of channel every time it updates the date rate, the original algorithm cannot set the rate to a specific number all the time.</span></div>
