originally wrote by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000296.html">Joel Spolsky</a> <br /><br />I&#8217;m not sure why XML got so sexy. It has its advantages; it&#8217;s sure a good idea for data interchange or for all those little files you need to store settings. But for real work it just can&#8217;t do what a solid, multiuser, relational database can do. The next time some uninformed analyst at Gartner or Giga or Forrester tells you &#8220;in the future, everything will be XML,&#8221; ask them how to do &#8220;SELECT author FROM books&#8221; fast with XML. Hint: you can&#8217;t. It has to be slow. XML is not the way to store a lot of data. Now tell me how to insert a new book at the beginning of the table without massive bitblts. Of course, I doubt if there is an analyst in one of those companies who would even understand that sentence, but that&#8217;s life. Now lets look at the books table in XML.<br /><br />&lt;?xml blah blah&gt;<br />&lt;books&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;book&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title&gt;UI Design for Programmers&lt;/title&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;author&gt;Joel Spolsky&lt;/author&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/book&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;book&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title&gt;The Chop Suey Club&lt;/title&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;author&gt;Bruce Weber&lt;/author&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/book&gt;<br />&lt;/books&gt;<br /><br />Quick question. What is the code to move to the next record?<br /><br />Uh&#8230;<br /><br />At this point a good programmer would say, well, let&#8217;s parse the XML into a tree in memory so that we can operate on it reasonably quickly. The amount of work that has to be done here by the CPU to SELECT author FROM books will bore you absolutely to tears. As every compiler writer knows, lexing and parsing are the slowest part of compiling. Suffice it to say that it involves a lot of string stuff, which we discovered is slow, and a lot of memory allocation stuff, which we discovered is slow, as we lex, parse, and build an abstract syntax tree in memory. That assumes that you have enough memory to load the whole thing at once. With relational databases, the performance of moving from record to record is fixed and is, in fact, one CPU instruction. That&#8217;s very much by design. And thanks to memory mapped files you only have to load the pages of disk that you are actually going to use. With XML, if you preparse, the performance of moving from record to record is fixed but there&#8217;s a huge startup time, and if you don&#8217;t preparse, the performance of moving from record to record varies based on the length of the record before it and is still hundreds of CPU instructions long.<br /><br />What this means to me is that you can&#8217;t use XML if you need performance and have lots of data. If you have a little bit of data, or if what you&#8217;re doing doesn&#8217;t have to be fast, XML is a fine format. And if you really want the best of both worlds, you have to come up with a way to store metadata next to your XML, something like Pascal strings&#8217; byte count, which give you hints about where things are in the file so that you don&#8217;t have to parse and scan for them. But of course then you can&#8217;t use text editors to edit the file because that messes up the metadata, so it&#8217;s not really XML anymore.<br /><br />&#8212;&#8212; <br />By the way, when I published this digest from Joel, I have no idea how to put the HTML code in my blog contents. Here is the <a href="http://www.digipassion.com/2009/02/writing-html-code-inside-post.html">solution</a>, and the full table of escape characters are <a href="http://www.theukwebdesigncompany.com/articles/entity-escape-characters.php">here</a>.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
also comes from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/GuerrillaInterviewing3.html">Joel on software</a> <br /><br />How do you detect smart in an interview? The first good sign is that you don’t have to explain things over and over again. The conversation just flows. Often, the candidate says something that shows real insight, or brains, or mental acuity. So an important part of the interview is creating a situation where someone can show you how smart they are. Remember, smart does not mean “knows the answer to trivia questions.” Anyway, software teams want to hire people with aptitude, not a particular skill set. Any skill set that people can bring to the job will be technologically obsolete in a couple of years, anyway, so it’s better to hire people that are going to be able to learn any new technology rather than people who happen to know how to make JDBC talk to a MySQL database right this minute. In general, the way to learn the most about a person is to let them do the talking. Give them open-ended questions and problems.<br /><br />That’s just a list of questions that I want to ask. Here’s a typical plan for interviewing a programmer:<br /><br />1. Introduction<br />2. Question about recent project candidate worked on<br />3. Easy Programming Question<br />4. Pointer/Recursion Question<br />5. Are you satisfied?<br />6. Do you have any questions? <br /><br />What should you look for during the open ended questions?<br /><br />One: Look for passion. Smart people are passionate about the projects they work on. They get very excited talking about the subject. They talk quickly, and get animated. Being passionately negative can be just as good a sign. “My last boss wanted to do everything on VAX computers because it was all he understood. What a dope!” There are far too many people around that can work on something and not really care one way or the other. It’s hard to get people like this motivated about anything.<br /><br />Bad candidates just don’t care and will not get enthusiastic at all during the interview. A really good sign that a candidate is passionate about something is that when they are talking about it, they will forget for a moment that they are in an interview. Sometimes a candidate comes in who is very nervous about being in an interview situation—this is normal, of course, and I always ignore it. But then when you get them talking about Computational Monochromatic Art they will get extremely excited and lose all signs of nervousness. Good. I like passionate people who really care. (To see an example of Computational Monochromatic Art try unplugging your monitor.) You can challenge them on something (try it—wait for them to say something that’s probably true and say “that couldn’t be true”) and they will defend themselves, even if they were sweating five minutes ago, because they care so much they forget that you are going to be making Major Decisions About Their Life soon.<br /><br />Two: Good candidates are careful to explain things well, at whatever level. I have rejected candidates because when they talked about their previous project, they couldn’t explain it in terms that a normal person could understand. Often CS majors will just assume that everyone knows what Bates Theorem is or what O(log n) means. If they start doing this, stop them for a minute and say, “could you do me a favor, just for the sake of the exercise, could you please explain this in terms my grandmother could understand.” At this point many people will still continue to use jargon and will completely fail to make themselves understood. Gong! You don’t want to hire them, basically, because they are not smart enough to comprehend what it takes to make other people understand their ideas.<br /><br />Three: If the project was a team project, look for signs that they took a leadership role. A candidate might say, “We were working on X, but the boss said Y and the client said Z.” I’ll ask, “So what did you do?” A good answer to this might be “I got together with the other members of the team and wrote a proposal…” A bad answer might be, “Well, there was nothing I could do. It was an impossible situation.” Remember, Smart and Gets Things Done. The only way you’re going to be able to tell if somebody Gets Things Done is to see if historically they have tended to get things done in the past. In fact, you can even ask them directly to give you an example from their recent past when they took a leadership role and got something done—overcoming some institutional inertia, for example.<br /><br />Most of the time in the interview, though, should be spent letting the candidate prove that they can write code. Reassure candidates that you understand that it’s hard to write code without an editor, and you will forgive them if the whiteboard gets really messy. Also you understand that it’s hard to write bug-free code without a compiler, and you will take that into account.<br /><br />These softball questions seem too easy, so when I first started asking them, I had to admit that I really expected everyone to sail right through them. What I discovered was that everybody solved the problem, but there was a lot of variation in how long it took them to solve. That reminded me of why I couldn’t trade bonds for a living (http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/GuerrillaInterviewing3.html), which means that if the basic concepts aren’t so easy that you don’t even have to think about them, you’re not going to get the big concepts. You see, if you can’t whiz through the easy stuff at 100 m.p.h., you’re never gonna get the advanced stuff.<br /><br />15 years of experience interviewing programmers has convinced me that the best programmers all have an easy aptitude for dealing with multiple levels of abstraction simultaneously. In programming, that means specifically that they have no problem with recursion (which involves holding in your head multiple levels of the call stack at the same time) or complex pointer-based algorithms (where the address of an object is sort of like an abstract representation of the object itself). Furthermore, I’ve come to realize that understanding pointers in C is not a skill, it’s an aptitude. Pointers require a complex form of doubly-indirected thinking that some people just can’t do, and it’s pretty crucial to good programming. A lot of the “script jocks” who started programming by copying JavaScript snippets into their web pages and went on to learn Perl never learned about pointers, and they can never quite produce code of the quality you need.<br /><br />That’s the source of all these famous interview questions you hear about, like “reversing a linked list” or “detect loops in a tree structure.” Even though the format of the interview is, superficially, just a candidate writing some code on the whiteboard, my real goal here is to have a conversation about it. “Why did you do it that way?” “What are the performance characteristics of your algorithm?” “What did you forget?” “Where’s your bug?”<br /><br />That means I don’t really mind giving programming problems that are too hard, as long as the candidate has some chance of starting out, and then I’m happy to dole out little hints along the way, little toeholds, so to speak. I might ask someone, say, to project a triangle onto a plane, a typical graphics problem, and I don’t mind helping them with the trig (SOH-CAH-TOA, baby!), and when I ask them how to speed it up, I might drop little hints about look-up tables. Notice that the kinds of hints I’m happy to provide are really just answers to trivia questions—the kinds of things that you find on Google.<br /><br />Inevitably, you will see a bug in their function. So we come to question five from my interview plan: “Are you satisfied with that code?” You may want to ask, “OK, so where’s the bug?” The quintessential Open Ended Question From Hell. All programmers make mistakes, there’s nothing wrong with that, they just have to be able to find them. With string functions in C, most college kids forget to null-terminate the new string. With almost any function, they are likely to have off-by-one errors. They will forget semicolons sometimes. Their function won’t work correctly on 0 length strings, or it will GPF if malloc fails… Very, very rarely, you will find a candidate that doesn’t have any bugs the first time. In this case, this question is even more fun. When you say, “There’s a bug in that code,” they will review their code carefully, and then you get to see if they can be diplomatic yet firm in asserting that the code is perfect.</div>

It&#8217;s whether they can communicate their ideas. By persuading other people, they get leverage. By writing clear comments and technical specs, they let other programmers understand their code, which means other programmers can use and work with their code instead of rewriting it. Absent this, their code is worthless. By writing clear technical documentation for end users, they allow people to figure out what their code is supposed to do, which is the only way those users can see the value in their code. There&#8217;s a lot of wonderful, useful code buried on sourceforge somewhere that nobody uses because it was created by programmers who don&#8217;t write very well (or don&#8217;t write at all), and so nobody knows what they&#8217;ve done and their brilliant code languishes.<br /><br />If you can write, wherever you get hired, you&#8217;ll soon find that you&#8217;re getting asked to write the specifications and that means you&#8217;re already leveraging your influence and getting noticed by management. Start a journal or weblog. The more you write, the easier it will be, and the easier it is to write, the more you&#8217;ll write, in a virtuous circle.<br /><br />Learn C<br /><br />C. Notice I didn&#8217;t say C++. Although C is becoming increasingly rare, it is still the lingua franca of working programmers. It is the language they use to communicate with one another, and, more importantly, it is much closer to the machine than &#8220;modern&#8221; languages that you&#8217;ll be taught in college like ML, Java, Python, whatever trendy junk they teach these days. You need to spend at least a semester getting close to the machine or you&#8217;ll never be able to create efficient code in higher level languages. You&#8217;ll never be able to work on compilers and operating systems, which are some of the best programming jobs around. You&#8217;ll never be trusted to create architectures for large scale projects. I don&#8217;t care how much you know about continuations and closures and exception handling: if you can&#8217;t explain why &#8220;while (*s++ = *t++);&#8221; copies a string, or if that isn&#8217;t the most natural thing in the world to you, well, you&#8217;re programming based on superstition, as far as I&#8217;m concerned: a medical doctor who doesn&#8217;t know basic anatomy, passing out prescriptions based on what the pharma sales babe said would work.<br /><br />some special cases to indicate this point<br />char bigString[1000];&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /* I never know how much to allocate&#8230; */ <br />bigString[0] = &#8216;\0&#8217;;<br />strcat(bigString,&#8221;John, &#8220;);<br />strcat(bigString,&#8221;Paul, &#8220;); <br />strcat(bigString,&#8221;George, &#8220;); <br />strcat(bigString,&#8221;Joel &#8220;);<br /><br />The time consumption will increase as the n^2, where n indicates the number of characters that have already in the char array, for the reason that every time the strcat will begin to search at the beginning of the array. To reduce the runtime decrease as linear as input number of values:<br />char* mystrcat( char* dest, char* src ) <br />{<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while (*dest) dest++; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while (*dest++ = *src++);<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return &#8211;dest;<br />}<br />char bigString[1000];&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /* I never know how much to allocate&#8230; */<br />char *p = bigString; <br />bigString[0] = &#8216;\0&#8217;; <br />p = mystrcat(p,&#8221;John, &#8220;);<br />p = mystrcat(p,&#8221;Paul, &#8220;); <br />p = mystrcat(p,&#8221;George, &#8220;);<br />p = mystrcat(p,&#8221;Joel &#8220;);<br /><br />The designers of Pascal were aware of this problem and &#8220;fixed&#8221; it by storing a byte count in the first byte of the string. These are called Pascal Strings. They can contain zeros and are not null terminated. Because a byte can only store numbers between 0 and 255, Pascal strings are limited to 255 bytes in length, but because they are not null terminated they occupy the same amount of memory as ASCIZ strings. The great thing about Pascal strings is that you never have to have a loop just to figure out the length of your string. Finding the length of a string in Pascal is one assembly instruction instead of a whole loop. It is monumentally faster.<br /><br />The old Macintosh operating system used Pascal strings everywhere. Many C programmers on other platforms used Pascal strings for speed. Excel uses Pascal strings internally which is why strings in many places in Excel are limited to 255 bytes, and it&#8217;s also one reason Excel is blazingly fast.<br /><br />For a long time, if you wanted to put a Pascal string literal in your C code, you had to write:<br /><br />char* str = &#8220;\006Hello!&#8221;;<br /><br />Yep, you had to count the bytes by hand, yourself, and hardcode it into the first byte of your string. Lazy programmers would do this, and have slow programs:<br /><br />char* str = &#8220;*Hello!&#8221;;<br />str[0] = strlen(str) - 1;<br /><br />Notice in this case you&#8217;ve got a string that is null terminated (the compiler did that) as well as a Pascal string. I used to call these fucked strings because it&#8217;s easier than calling them null terminated pascal strings but this is a rated-G channel so you will have use the longer name.<br /><br />Well, since we&#8217;re looking at the bits today I shouldn&#8217;t have ignored this. I should have done this correctly: figured out how many bytes I needed and allocated the right amount of memory. Shouldn&#8217;t I have?<br /><br />Because otherwise, you see, a clever hacker will read my code and notice that I&#8217;m only allocating 1000 bytes and hoping it will be enough, and they&#8217;ll find some clever way to trick me into strcatting a 1100 byte string into my 1000 bytes of memory, thus overwriting the stack frame and changing the return address so that when this function returns, it executes some code which the hacker himself wrote. This is what they&#8217;re talking about when they say that a particular program has a buffer overflow susceptibility. It was the number one cause of hacks and worms in the olden days before Microsoft Outlook made hacking easy enough for teenagers to do.<br /><br />(bold malloc&#8230;)How does the malloc work? The nature of malloc is that it has a long linked list of available blocks of memory called the free chain. When you call malloc, it walks the linked list looking for a block of memory that is big enough for your request. Then it cuts that block into two blocks &#8211; one the size you asked for, the other with the extra bytes, and gives you the block you asked for, and puts the leftover block (if any) back into the linked list. When you call free, it adds the block you freed onto the free chain. Eventually, the free chain gets chopped up into little pieces and you ask for a big piece and there are no big pieces available the size you want. So malloc calls a timeout and starts rummaging around the free chain, sorting things out, and merging adjacent small free blocks into larger blocks. This takes 3 1/2 days. The end result of all this mess is that the performance characteristic of malloc is that it&#8217;s never very fast (it always walks the free chain), and sometimes, unpredictably, it&#8217;s shockingly slow while it cleans up. (This is, incidentally, the same performance characteristic of garbage collected systems, surprise surprise, so all the claims people make about how garbage collection imposes a performance penalty are not entirely true, since typical malloc implementations had the same kind of performance penalty, albeit milder.)<br /><br />Smart programmers minimize the potential distruption of malloc by always allocating blocks of memory that are powers of 2 in size. You know, 4 bytes, 8 bytes, 16 bytes, 18446744073709551616 bytes, etc. For reasons that should be intuitive to anyone who plays with Lego, this minimizes the amount of weird fragmentation that goes on in the free chain. Although it may seem like this wastes space, it is also easy to see how it never wastes more than 50% of the space. So your program uses no more than twice as much memory as it needs to, which is not that big a deal. Furthermore, when you call realloc, you should always double the size of memory that was previously allocated. That means that you never have to call realloc more than lg n times, which has decent performance characteristics even for huge strings, and you never waste more than 50% of your memory.</div>

说到Unix为我们所带来的软件开发的哲学，我必需要说一说。Unix遵循的原则是KISS（Keep it simple, stupid）。在http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy 上有很多的基本上大同小异的Unix哲学，都是很经典的。<br /><br />Doug McIlroy 是认为UNIX的哲学是这样的：三条哲学，简明扼要，就是这三条哲学贯穿着整个Unix世界。尤其是第一条“do one thing and do it well”真是相当精彩！<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Write programs that do one thing and do it well.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Write programs to work together.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.<br /><br />只要是Unix的程序员，他们会比别的程序员在任何时候都会不停地强调着这三条哲学。<br /><br />而《The Art of Unix Programming》总结了下面这些哲学，都是至理名言啊。<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Rule of Modularity: Write simple parts connected by clean interfaces.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Rule of Clarity: Clarity is better than cleverness.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Rule of Composition: Design programs to be connected to other programs.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Rule of Separation: Separate policy from mechanism; separate interfaces from engines.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Rule of Simplicity: Design for simplicity; add complexity only where you must.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Rule of Parsimony: Write a big program only when it is clear by demonstration that nothing else will do.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Rule of Transparency: Design for visibility to make inspection and debugging easier.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Rule of Robustness: Robustness is the child of transparency and simplicity.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Rule of Representation: Fold knowledge into data so program logic can be stupid and robust.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Rule of Least Surprise: In interface design, always do the least surprising thing.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Rule of Silence: When a program has nothing surprising to say, it should say nothing.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Rule of Repair: When you must fail, fail noisily and as soon as possible.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Rule of Economy: Programmer time is expensive; conserve it in preference to machine time.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Rule of Generation: Avoid hand-hacking; write programs to write programs when you can.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Rule of Optimization: Prototype before polishing. Get it working before you optimize it.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Rule of Diversity: Distrust all claims for “one true way”.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Rule of Extensibility: Design for the future, because it will be here sooner than you think.<br /><br />X Windows 的设计者 Mike Gancarz 给出了下面九条哲学思想<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Small is beautiful.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Make each program do one thing well.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Build a prototype as soon as possible.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Choose portability over efficiency.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Store data in flat text files.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Use software leverage to your advantage.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. Use shell scripts to increase leverage and portability.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. Avoid captive user interfaces.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 9. Make every program a filter.<br /><br /><br />十条不错的编程观点<br />1） The only “best practice” you should be using all the time is “Use Your Brain”, rather than some so-called &#8220;famous&#8221; frameworks, methods, classes, or prototypes.<br />2）Programmers who don’t code in their spare time for fun will never become as good as those that do.<br />3）Most comments in code are in fact a pernicious form of code duplication, which should explain &#8220;why&#8221;, rather than &#8220;how&#8221; and &#8220;what&#8221;.<br />4）XML is highly overrated<br />5）Not all programmers are created equal<br />6）”Googling it” is okay!<br />7）If you only know one language, no matter how well you know it, you’re not a great programmer.<br />8）Your job is to put yourself out of work. Or, saying, if you can’t be replaced then you can’t be promoted!<br />9）Design patterns are hurting good design more than they’re helping it.<br />10）Unit Testing won’t help you write good code</div>

Each of the letters are (nearly always) &#8216;r&#8217; for read permitted, &#8216;w&#8217; for write permitted, or &#8216;x&#8217; for execute permitted.<br /><br />The letters always appear in groups of three. Within a group, the order is always &#8216;rwx&#8217;. The first group of three indicate operations permitted to the owner of the file; the second group of three indicates operations permitted to other users in the same group as the owner; the third group of three indicates operations permitted to all users who can access the file.<br /><br />If the file is a directory, &#8216;x&#8217; means that files in the directory may be accessed if referred to directly by name, but wildcard substitutions (&#8216;*&#8217;) and ls operations will not be permitted.<br /><br />Modes are usually represented inside programs by a sequence of three octal digits. each octal digit represents one of the groups of three characters, 4 for &#8216;r&#8217; plus 2 for &#8216;w&#8217; plus 1 for &#8216;x&#8217;. In C and C++ programs remember that numbers with leading zeros are always assumed to be in octal, so the mode 0751 represents rwxr-x&#8211;x.</div>

In this way, you could have a struct that contains a union, so that the &#8220;static&#8221;, or similar portion of the data is described first, and the portion that changes is described by the union. The idea of a union could be handled in a different way by having 2 different structs defined, and making a pointer to each kind of struct. The pointer to struct &#8220;a&#8221; could be assigned to the value of a buffer, and the pointer to struct &#8220;b&#8221; could be assigned to the same buffer, but now a-&gt;somefield and b-&gt;someotherfield are both located in the same buffer. That is the idea behind a union. It gives different ways to break down the same buffer area.</div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></div><h2 style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><a class="h2heading h2" href="" name="Answer:" style="color: black; font-size: 16px; outline-style: none; padding: 0px; text-decoration: none;">Answer:</a></h2><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The difference between structure and union in c are: 1. union allocates the memory equal to the maximum memory required by the member of the union but structure allocates the memory equal to the total memory required by the members. 2. In union, one block is used by all the member of the union but in case of structure, each member have their own memory space</div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></div><h2 style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><a class="h2heading h2" href="" name="Difference_in_their_Usage:" style="color: black; font-size: 16px; outline-style: none; padding: 0px; text-decoration: none;">Difference in their Usage:</a></h2><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">While structure enables us treat a number of different variables stored at different in memory , a union enables us to treat the same space in memory as a number of different variables. That is a Union offers a way for a section of memory to be treated as a variable of one type on one occasion and as a different variable of a different type on another occasion.</div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">There is frequent rwquirement while interacting with hardware to&nbsp;<a class="iAs" href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_are_the_differences_between_a_union_and_a_structure_in_C#" style="background-color: transparent ! important; border-bottom: 0.1em solid rgb(0, 100, 0) ! important; border-left-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; bottom: auto; color: rgb(0, 100, 0) ! important; display: inline; float: none; font-family: inherit ! important; font-size: 12px; font-weight: normal ! important; left: auto; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; outline-style: none; padding-bottom: 1px ! important; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px; position: static ! important; right: auto; text-align: left; text-decoration: underline ! important; top: auto;" target="_blank">access</a>&nbsp;access a byte or group of bytes simultaneously and sometimes each byte individually.
