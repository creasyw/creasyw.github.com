<div><br /></div><div>From http://www.livescience.com/</div>By Jeanna Bryner, LiveScience Senior Writer<br />posted: 12 September 2009 10:54 am ET<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br /><div><br /></div><div><br />Our personalities do more for us than determine our social circles. Temperament can impact a person&#8217;s physical health.<br /><br />&#8220;The idea that behavior or personality traits can influence health is one that&#8217;s been around for a long time. We&#8217;re just now getting a handle on to what extent they do,&#8221; said Stephen Boyle of Duke University Medical Center in North Carolina.<br /><br />From those with a chill demeanor to the completely frazzled types, mental factors are ultimately tied to physical health. And while a highly neurotic person might deteriorate more quickly than others, not every character trait will kill you. Some might even boost lifetimes.<br /><br /><b>No. 7: Cynicism</b><br /><br />Cynics who tend to be suspicious and mistrustful of others, a character trait that scientists refer to as hostility, may have an increased likelihood of developing heart disease. &#8220;These aren&#8217;t necessarily hot-headed people, but people who are more likely to read into people&#8217;s behavior as some hostile motive,&#8221; Boyle said during a telephone interview.<br /><br />In a study of more than 300 Vietnam veterans who were healthy at the study start, Boyle found that those who scored high on measures of hostility were about 25 percent more likely to develop heart disease.<br /><br />Boyle and his colleagues think that hostile individuals might experience more stress, which can cause spikes in an immune-system protein called C3 that has been linked with various diseases, including diabetes. In fact, the participants with higher scores on hostility showed an increase in these proteins while the non-hostile men showed no such increase.<br /><br /><b>No. 6: Lack of meaning</b><br /><br />If you lack a sense of purpose, your stay on Earth could be truncated. A study involving more than 1,200 elderly participants who didn&#8217;t have dementia at the study&#8217;s start found that those who indicated having a high purpose in life were about half as likely to die over the study period, which lasted up to five years. The results, published in the June 15 issue of the journal Psychosomatic Medicine, held regardless of a person&#8217;s age, sex, education and race, along with level of depression and neuroticism.<br /><br />&#8220;Persons with high purpose readily derive meaning from and make sense of the events of their lives, and likely engage in behaviors and activities that they deem important,&#8221; said study researcher Patricia Boyle of the Rush Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease Center in Chicago.<br /><br />Some other research has suggested that people with a higher sense of purpose may have different levels of stress hormones, better heart health or improved immune systems, though more research is needed to firm up any of these biological mechanisms, she said.<br /><br />The opposite also holds: &#8220;The findings from our study suggested that people who no longer set and work actively toward goals or enjoy their day-to-day activities (how they spend their time) are those with greater mortality risk,&#8221; Boyle told LiveScience.<br /><br /><b>No. 5: Fretting</b><br /><br />People who are highly neurotic — constantly worried and anxious, and prone to depression — die sooner on average than their chill counterparts. And a recently reported study of nearly 1,800 men followed over a 30-year period suggests that&#8217;s partly because neurotics are also more likely to smoke. Perhaps having a cigarette eases anxiety, said study researcher Daniel Mroczek of Purdue University in Indiana, adding that such a short-term payoff might not be worth it if it kills you down the line.<br /><br /><b>No. 4: Lack of self-control</b><br /><br />Late for appointments? Can&#8217;t keep your desk organized? No self-control? These seeming benign qualities could take a toll on your health.<br /><br />A review of more than 20 studies and nearly 9,000 participants revealed people who are conscientious — organized, self-disciplined, as opposed to impulsive — live two to four years longer than others. Study researcher Howard S. Friedman of the University of California, Riverside suspects the boost in lifetime can be attributed partly to the fact that highly conscientious individuals are less likely to smoke or drink to excess, and live more stable and less stressful lives. The study is detailed in a 2008 issue of the journal Health Psychology.<br /><br /><b>No. 3: Anxiety</b><br /><br />The jitters can put a strain on your noggin, research suggests. Compared with the highly frazzled, Individuals with a mellow demeanor who are outgoing may be less likely to develop dementia, which can be caused by Alzheimer&#8217;s disease and other illnesses. The claim is based on a study that followed more than 500 elderly individuals for five years. Among the outgoing extroverts, dementia risk was 50 percent lower for participants who were calm compared with those who were prone to distress.<br /><br /><b>No. 2: Gloom and doom</b><br /><br />The gloomy, inhibited person is not just at a disadvantage socially, but also physically.<br /><br />A preliminary study of more than 180 patients suffering from peripheral arterial disease (plaque buildup in the arteries) showed participants with so-called type D, or distressed, personality, had an increased odds of dying sooner than other people. Type-D people are more likely to experience negative emotions while at the same time hold in their feelings.<br /><br />The researchers, who detail their work in the August issue of the journal Archives of Surgery, suggest the personality type is linked with the body&#8217;s immune system as well as stress response system.<br /><br /><b>No. 1: Stress</b><br /><br />Whatever you do, don&#8217;t let this list worry you! Research is showing that prolonged stress can be deadly, and if it doesn&#8217;t do you in, workplace stress can increase your chances of heart disease, flu virus, metabolic syndrome and having high blood pressure.<br /><br />A study of nearly 700 Israeli workers found that those who experienced job burnout (when work stress becomes unmanageable) were nearly twice as likely to develop type 2 diabetes, in which a person&#8217;s body becomes resistant to the sugar-regulating hormone called insulin.<br /><br />And while a job promotion might boost your income, it also stresses you out. British researchers recently found that when people get promoted, they suffer on average about 10 percent more mental strain and are less likely to find time to go to the doctor.</div></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Everybody wants to preach to the young, and tell them to be good and they will be happy. I shall not enter far upon that field, but confine myself to presenting from a business man&#8217;s standpoint of view, a few rules, which, I believe, lie at the root of business success.<br /><br />First&#8211;Never enter a bar-room. Do not drink liquor as a beverage. I will not paint the evil of drunkenness, or the moral crime; but I suggest to you that it is low and common to enter a bar-room, unworthy of any self-respecting man, and sure to fasten upon you a taint which will operate to your disadvantage in life, whether you ever become a drunkard or not.<br /><br />Second&#8211;I wish young men would not use tobacco&#8211;not that it is morally wrong, except in so far as it is used in excess and injures health, which the medical faculty declares it does. But the use of tobacco requires young men to withdraw themselves from the society of women to indulge the habit. I think the absence of women from any assembly tends to lower the tone of that assembly. The habit of smoking tends to carry young men into the society of men whom it is not desirable that they should choose as their intimate associates. The practice of chewing tobacco was once common. Now it is considered offensive. I believe the race is soon to take another step forward, and that the coming man is to consider smoking as offensive as chewing was formally considered. As it is practically abandoned now, so I believe smoking will be.<br /><br />Third&#8211;Having entered upon work, continue in that line of work. Fight it out on that line (except in extreme cases), for it matters little what avenue a young man finds first. Success can be attained in any branch of human labor. There is always room at the top in every pursuit. Concentrate all your thought and energy upon the performance of your duties. Put all your eggs into one basket and then watch that basket, do not scatter your shot. The man who is director in a half dozen railroads and three or four manufacturing companies, or who tries at one and the same time to work a farm, a factory, a line of street cars, a political party and a store, rarely amounts to much. He may be concerned in the management of more than one business enterprise, but they should all be of the one kind, which he understands. The great successes of life are made by concentration.<br /><br />Fourth&#8211;Do not think a man has done his full duty when he has performed the work assigned him. A man will never rise if he does only this. Promotion comes from exceptional work. A man must discover where his employer&#8217;s interests can be served beyond the range of the special work allotted to him; and whenever he sees his employer&#8217;s interests suffer, or wherever the latter&#8217;s interests can be promoted, tell him so. Differ from your employers upon what you think his mistakes. You will never make much of a success if you do not learn the needs and opportunities of your own branch much better than your employer can possibly do. You have been told to &#8220;obey orders if you break owners.&#8221; Do no such foolish thing. If your employer starts upon a course which you think will prove injurious, tell him so, protest, give your reasons, and stand to them unless convinced you are wrong. It is the young man who does this, that capital wants for a partner or for a son-in-law.<br /><br />Fifth&#8211;Whatever your wages are, save a little. Live within your means. The heads of stores, farms, banks, lawyers&#8217; offices, physicians&#8217; offices, insurance companies, mills and factories are not seeking capital; they are seeking brains and business habits. The man who saves a little from his income has given the surest indication of the qualities which every employer is seeking for.<br /><br />Sixth&#8211;Never speculate. Never buy or sell grain or stocks upon a margin. If you have savings, invest them in solid securities, lands or property. The man who gambles upon the exchanges is in the condition of the man who gambles at the gaming table. He rarely, if ever, makes a permanent success. His judgment goes; his faculties are snapped; and his end, as a rule, is nervous prostration after an unworthy and useless life.<br /><br />Seventh&#8211;If you ever enter business for yourself, never indorse for others. It is dishonest. All your resources and all your credit are the sacred property of the men who have trusted you; and until you have surplus cash and owe no man, it is dishonest to give your name as an indorser to others. Give the cash you can spare, if you wish, to help a friend. Your name is too sacred to give.<br /><br />Do not make riches, but usefulness, your first aim; and let your chief pride be that your daily occupation is in the line of progress and development; that your work, in whatever capacity it may be, is useful work, honestly conducted, and as such ennobling to your life.<br /><br />To sum up, do not drink, do not smoke, do not indorse, do not speculate. Concentrate, perform more than your prescribed duties; be strictly honest in word and deed. And may all who read these words be just as happy and prosperous and long lived as I wish them all to be. And let this great fact always cheer them: It is impossible for any one to be cheated out of an honorable career unless he cheats himself.</div>

<div><div><br /></div><div>(from readwriteweb.com)</div><div><br /></div><div>1. <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">You&#8217;re always looking for opportunities.</span> This is almost the definition of an entrepreneur. Every pain point is an opportunity.</div><div><br /></div><div>2. <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Are you prepared to work long hours, every day, for an indefinite period of time?</span> Ahem, let&#8217;s dispel illusions. Put down &#8220;The 4-Hour Workweek&#8221;; it is a myth that the author spun to sell books (so that he could work 4 hours a week).</div><div><br /></div><div>3. <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Good Health.</span> You cannot answer &#8220;Yes&#8221; to item #2 unless you are blessed with good health and the discipline to maintain it in tough times.</div><div><br /></div><div>4. <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Do you have a unique service or product?</span> Most entrepreneurs have a pocketful of ideas, many of them viable. But they suffer from the &#8220;kid in a candy store&#8221; dilemma, not knowing which to choose. The trick is choosing the one that really is a winner and having the discipline (see item #9) to ignore all the others.</div><div><br /></div><div>5.<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"> Are you willing to make short-term sacrifices for long-term success?</span> There will be long periods of time when everyone around you questions your sanity, and on all normal metrics (hours worked and stress endured vs. material rewards gained), they would be right.</div><div><br /></div><div>6.<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"> Honesty and integrity</span>. You often have to be able to work with people without the protection of legal contracts. It is the essence of moving fast, and you often simply won&#8217;t be able to afford a lawyer. So, you have to work with people who have honesty and integrity. It is hard to do that unless you have honesty and integrity yourself.</div><div><br /></div><div>7. <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">You&#8217;re dreaming miles ahead while focused on what you&#8217;re doing right now.</span> The entrepreneur is an odd mix: part dreamer, part brutal realist and pragmatist. You should focus first on today and, secondly, on the big picture, and ignore the rest. Today is about the immediate stuff that you have to get done to stay in business, to deliver projects to clients, to collect cash, and so on. The big picture is about looking at what the world might look like 10 years from now and then building towards that. We cannot know what will happen next week, month, or year. The medium term is totally unknown. However, many long-term trends are fairly clear, even though the timetable is unknown.</div><div><br /></div><div>8. <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Are you self-confident? </span>You will almost certainly be going against odds that would make most people run away.</div><div><br /></div><div>9. <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Discipline.</span> This relates to many of the other traits mentioned in this checklist. You will need discipline to maintain your health (item #2), so that you can work hard (item #3), so that you can focus on the one product or service you have chosen and ignore all temptations (item #4).</div><div><br /></div><div>10. <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">You&#8217;re prepared to say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, but I&#8217;ll figure it out.&#8221;</span> Entrepreneurs have to be generalists. They may know one thing very, very well. But they also have to know enough about almost everything else to occasionally do those things themselves, and have the judgment to eventually hire the right people to do those things.</div></div></div>

<div><br /></div><div>这是华山上最为常见的一个标语。</div><div><br /></div><div>在忙碌过后的一个急刹车，用一种近乎自虐的方式。体能还没有从接连的熬夜里恢复过来，就选择了攀爬这座以险峻闻名于世西岳，回想起来还真是佩服自己。一趟华山，需要总结的东西很多。譬如，应当结伴而行，否则很有可能半途而废；应当下午开始爬山，而不是像华阴镇上很多小旅店招揽顾客宣称的“夜爬华山”，否则会错过许多奇美的景致；上山沿盘山道而行，下山坐索道，是个符合体力曲线的好方法；山顶旅馆贵的夸张，租个帐篷若干好友连聊带休息，既经济划算而且别有趣味；早晨登顶，掐算好时间，完全没有必要租什么军大衣，否则就是像我一样，纯粹变成了考验自己体力的负重训练；等等……</div><div><br /></div><div>千丈崖也好、天梯也好，还是临空的栈道也好。考验体力，更考验毅力。路上偶尔可以遇到有人坐在石阶上咒骂“他妈的，老子再也不来了”，或者是“不爬了，老娘把这辈子的山都爬完了”……而我们同行的四个人，就像是大多数人一样，互相鼓励，开着玩笑，然后一路向前。最搞笑的是猪，这哥们儿对于时间很是敏感：几点了，爬了多久，需要再多久到那个里程。途中租我们帐篷的小哥说话总是不靠谱，问他再爬多久到东峰，他说20分钟，结果我们爬了40分钟；问他几点日出，他说六点半，结果幸亏没有信他，我们五点半看到了红彤彤的太阳。还有一次，问他再多少分钟能到下一个洗手间，他说两分钟。然后猪说，“好，我就掐两分钟的时间，时间一到我马上就尿……”……挺好的。</div><div><br /></div><div>路上的八卦也不错。猪和志，一眼就能看出有夫妻相，可是两个人都装傻。于是，我只能从对话中窥探某些线索。譬如，志说，“爬山爬的，我的大腿小腿都不是我的了”。于是，猪说，“那就都是我的”。又譬如，志问猪，“你背个军大衣不累么？”猪说，“没关系。再多的衣服也能背！”志说，“那我就把衣服都脱给你背。”猪大喜，说，“@#￥%&amp;。”然后就被志晾到一边，半天没有搭理^_^</div><div><br /></div><div>有关标题的这个警示语，本想写篇励志文章的。结果发现明显跑题了。写不来那种小故事大道理的文章。不过感触很深。景色很美，但看景走路，很容易就会掉入深到恐怖的山涧。于是，两者只能择其一——视体力而定，视心情而定，视目的而定。其实，不只是爬华山。其实做什么事情都是这样的。</div><div><br /></div></div>

华山西岳啊~~~我当时初中二年级时候去了华山，西岳当时刚刚出了事，那个台阶的链子断了，掉下去了不少人的说，所以封山不许等，我就登了最高的南峰，北峰索道一上去就到了也算不上登了~~呵呵~~~那时候小可能不怕死，一些绕壁走的那种小道没护栏的，下面是深渊我还来回过来过去，把我那两老给吓死，现在真是佩服自己，哈哈~~~</div>

这种感觉我也有过，不过已经在几年前为RAUL释放出来了。哎。<BR/>费德勒已经辉煌过那么久了，没关系……没关系……让曾经最强大的他留在记忆中就好咯。纳豆没出现之前就预料到一定有那么一天的了..</div>
