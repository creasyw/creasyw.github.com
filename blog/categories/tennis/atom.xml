    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It was better than I expected:)</p>

<p>The main changes came from a few simple suggestions of my coach: keeping patient in rally; making percentage shoots and reducing unforced errors as many as possible; warming up longer than I used to; and balance myself while serving. That was it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I suppose my working out in gym also pays off. Several months ago, I started to divide the strength training to smaller parts as upper/lower/core body, along with cardio exercise. For each part, there are several different approaches to work out. Specifically for tennis, the back and core muscles are more important than those of chest and shoulder for ground strokes. A little bit exercises for the forearm could improve the penetration of serving a lot. Lower muscles are much much more important than I expected–they could provide more explosive strength, let running faster, and more importantly, protect the knee joints. Besides, pilate and stretch are indispensable parts for every workout. These last-30-minutes cooling down process help the body relax and keep up with everyday’s progress.</p>

<p>Of course, I still have plenty of REALLY weak aspects, such as lousy serving, bad backspin and volley, and getting lost in the mid-court…</p>

<p>Anyway, I am happy to get this level:) and wish myself could be the champion one day.</p>

<p>UPDATE 09/03/2014. I just saw the greatest match in this year, Murray vs. Djokovic. There are some interesting facts.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Both of them slided their feet together while hitting the serving, but when I did that way, my upper body would become unstable which in turn makes my serving even worse…</li>
  <li>Percentage shoots are the mainstream responses, and they would more inclined to approach to the net when hitting down the line.</li>
  <li>Both of them use lots of backspin for defense, but their movements seemed to have more “chopping” than I did. And if I did that way, the ball would float very high and sail…</li>
  <li>Drop shots are effective means to explore the depth of the court. Making the opponents running is almost always a good strategy to disrupt the tempo as well as actively draining off the energy.</li>
  <li>Mental toughness is the key to win the match.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are two dimensions for a court. I just kept forgetting it! It is always worthwhile to explore both left/right and mid/back of the court. As an amateur like me, the most struggling part might be forced to constantly adjust the tempo. I should keep pushing in this kind of manner more often.</p>

<p>It is almost always a wiser choice to stick to the “percentage shot” for both forehand and backhand. I had too many unforced errors hitting down the line. However, on the other hand, when I stand in the middle of the court, I should be more comfortable to change the direction. For most of the opponents, they would struggle more in their backhands. So I could try more inside-out.</p>

<p>I have a better volley technique, but am still awful in both timing and positioning. I can serve with more power, and a little bit more consistent. The next step will be taking more control in direction. Besides, I need to prepare earlier/higher and hit with looser wrist for the ground stroke. I also need push the momentum forward when I hit the ball. It’s almost one year since I learned this activity, but I still cannot master its most basic part…</p>

<p>Well, anyhow =D</p>

<p>[UPDATE 20/07/2014: I just had a big victory this afternoon: 6-1 and 6-2, against the guy who used to beat me twice. Although it would never be a big deal for winning or losing an amateur game, I still feel really happy for that. I have more control for percentage shot and decrease unforced errors a lot.</p>

<p>Aiming higher in the net also could push opponent further away from the court, then have a better chance receiving a shallow response, and then move into the court, hit down the line, and move forward more for volley – this is a right sequence from building to ending a point. Deep balls with strong top spin would seldom be a good chance to change the direction. Instead, just hit cross court and try to be as deep as I can, meanwhile aiming bouncing towards the baseline rather than the side line.</p>

<p>Maybe it’s really useful to keep thinking both during the match and afterwards, it makes me evolve stronger; or maybe my exercises of lower body and core muscles finally pay out; or maybe my resting and eating schedule give me more energy to do the movements right; or more possibly, my opponent just had a bad day. Well…</p>

<p>I love this game, both mentally and physically(:  ]</p>

<p>[UPDATE 24/07/2014: Lost a game. However, anyway, the take-way points are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Prepare earlier.</li>
  <li>Be patient. Anyone could make mistakes in any time.</li>
  <li>Be relax when serving.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<ul>
  <li>Ideally, every time hitting the ball should be a “kinetic chain of reactions”– the momentum moves from feet to knee, to waist, to shoulder, and finally to the forearm and wrist.</li>
  <li>If I only use part of the chain, I might still hit a good ball, occasionally. But it would consume more energy, and the hitting would be much more unstable.</li>
  <li>Technically speaking, serve is the only way that I can completely control this kinetic chain, because I can control all of the paces and do not need to move around.</li>
  <li>During a point, whenever opponent hits the ball, I should pause and split feet, no matter where I am in the court. This could help me make judgment. More importantly, it is the way to “load energy” and start the “kinetic chain”.</li>
  <li>I have too many aspects to improve, but this might be the most important one.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last Thursday, I had another win in the league(: In my point of view, I was pretty lucky for the previous victories, but I did have an overwhelming victory this time. I was much better than one month ago (yeah! of course=P), and the opponent was a sub-player, who was weaker than others in the league. Although he had a strong surfing, both his forehand and backhand were not so good. The responses were soft and shallow with only a little bit back spin, which gave me a wide angel to hit either inside-in or inside-out.</p>

<p>When I talked with my coach yesterday, he provided some valuable insights about how I should consider the process of a match</p>

<ul>
  <li>Keep the feet floating while preparing ground stroke.</li>
  <li><strong>Volley is the only way to end a point</strong>. No matter how aggressive the ground strokes are, they are not considered to end the point. Instead, they just <em>build</em> the point. If it ends, let it be. If not, that’s the normal case. It means I should always prepare for the next stroke. And the sad part of the story is that after nine months I still don’t really know how to end a point……</li>
  <li>Do not get frustrated playing with players who consistently send lofty backspin. If he voluntarily hands over the control of pace, I should use it wisely: add more topspin on the returns; actively change the angel; don’t rush to end the point but patiently build it.</li>
  <li>Prepare earlier: decide to use forehand or backhand based on the trajectory; once decided, prepare for the ready position; after the bounce, I should begin the movement of hitting; the center of gravity should put into the front halves of the feet, and always keep the momentum forward while hitting the ball.</li>
</ul>

    <updated>2014-03-01T14:29:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://creasyw.github.io/blog/2014/03/01/strategic-playing-for-the-first-several-sets</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It is worth noting that yesterday I had my first win in the 3.0 league=D 7-5, 3-6, and 10-6 in the tie-breaker set. In today’s lesson, Bob told me a bit more about strategic playing. It was all about probing different aspects of the opponent.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Keep hitting in the middle (or either left or right) as long as I can, and see what is the tolerance of the opponent – whether him or me would get frustrated first and try to make some change.</li>
  <li>Consistently push either his backhand or forehand within a point.</li>
  <li>Driving the ball from side to side and observe the pattern of his transition – does he have a high successful rate for the ground stroke while moving? Is his forehand-to-backhand better or worse than the backhand-to-forehand? Does he tend to hit cross court or staight down to the line?</li>
</ul>

<p>The advanced version will also include the timing of pushing towards the net as well as volley, but I haven’t got there yet… I am still struggling to position myself in the transition of volley, let alone the judgement of lobbing or cut-across from my opponent… So, there is a long way to go(:</p>

<p>[Update March 7] The control of my ground stroke is nice, but the hitting point is far from optimal – I should keep the racquet a little bit “closer” and the hitting point should be a little bit in front while the racquet rising in its maximum speed and facing towards the net. Still, The target zone is “higher in the net”.</p>

<p>[Update March 15] The way to increase spin is to make the preparison faster and to prepare the racquet a little bit lower–all movements should be done before the bonuce.</p>
