  <div class="entry-content"><p>I heard lots of opinions from both Mac lovers and haters before I bought my macbook pro. It made me struggle for a while to leverage the pros and cons. But it finally turned out neither of them was completely right. I love my mbp very much, but the reason is not the good looking, but the flexibility interacting with unix programs and great ease using homebrew for almost all dependent packages. Besides, if I was not forced using Windows OS again in my internship, I would not notice how ugly and inconvenient it is.</p>

<p>The same process happened once again when I met latex. The final result was that I fell in love with it, and found out no one gave me a comprehensive description about it before.</p>

<p>LaTeX is more about higher-level accessing Tex for formating and typesetting. That is it. The focus for writing, the ease of math formulas, and even the licensing advantage over MS are all derivatives from others personal experiences. Actually, the basic intention gives it the most attractive feature. First of all, setting up a general framework, then maybe another subset of framework. The framework is at will, but everything fell into it must follow the specific rules. Then, beyond the framework, or within the framework, everything is also at will. One can freely design all specifications, and if needed, one can also overwrite the general rules set by the framework. On the one hand, the environment setting let author get rid of all trivial concerns. On the other hand, in every place, one can regain the control of everything. LaTeX is not only for writing, it is for programming.</p>

<p>Then, several days ago, I was trying to transfer my blog from Blogger to Jekyll. It is a static site generator that takes Markdown blog posts and onverts them into html files. The benefits are attractive: the website can be hosted by almost any server; the whole blog can easily be version controlled, since no php or MySQL needed, it requires less maintainance. During playing with it, I have the same kind of feeling again. I might easily mess everything up while on the other hand I have fully control of every element in the page.</p>

<p>I cannot build it without kind-hearted help from others. Especially,</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/yanga9">Alex Yang</a>, who designs this theme. I really like the succinct layout and the Hello page. His comprehensive introductory email also saved me lots of time and gave me solid understanding of how jekyll and octopress work.</li>
<li><a href="http://octopress.org/docs/setup/">Octopress: Getting started</a> and an <a href="http://labs.grupow.com/blog/2012/01/30/start-blogging-with-octopress">alternative post</a>. Provide fool-proof tutorials of setting things up. For the latter post, there is no need to insall Pow. The &ldquo;rake preview&rdquo; will get the result with <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17465404/rake-preview-not-working-in-octopress">one precaution</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/juniorz/1564581">Import from Blogger</a>. This script was found from Jekyll official site.</li>
<li><a href="http://conghui.github.io/2013/04/27/did-not-find-expected-key-while-parsing-a-block-mapping/">Rake Generate issue caused by double quotes</a>. The script above cannot well handle double quotes, which will cause problem when generating yaml. Here is the solution.</li>
</ul>


<p>Of course, there are some other things that I tried and failed to like. C++ might be an example&hellip; =P Anyway, my point is, regardless what other people say, you will never know what a thing really is unless you actually do it. There is one ultimate goal for a given project, and at least one suitable path to get there. Just do it. Then in retrospect, we will know if it is a better option, and will perform better the next time.</p>

  Aug. 10th. Complete the 1st chapter of sicp.<br/><br/>
  
  I really appreciate the exercises within each subsections, because I can feel that they are well designed. I used to have the same feeling when I did the homework from Dan&#8217;s course of programming languages. The exercises make the general concepts concrete and doable.
  <br/><br/>
  The abstraction is far from merely making the code more structured and readable. It is a design choice. Sometimes, it takes experience to find out where should be abstracted. And sometimes, it takes much more endeavors than simply mix everything together. But once the choice of abstraction is right, the program becomes clearer, and it increases many degrees of freedom for the design afterwards.</div>

&nbsp;<br />At the end of the 1st chapter, it enumerates the basic reason for the powerful lisp: first-order procedure.<br /><br />The major &#8220;privileges&#8221; of the first-order elements are:<br />1) They may be named by variables.<br />2) They may be passed as arguments to procedures.<br />3) They may be returned as the results of procedures.<br />4) They may be included in data structures.<br />They can be crucial abstraction mechanism permitting to express the general methods of computing as explicit elements in programming language, so that they can be handled just like other computational elements. The expression power is enormous.<br /><br />I have already been used to use the first two kinds of procedures, but the last two actually make the program even more expressive and powerful. Those are also the attractive properties sharing among functional programming languages.</div>

<br />While I am reading, I always try to distinguish which part of thoughts I used to learn from here when I read it for the first time, and which part I learned from Dan&#8217;s course. And, surprisingly enough, I learned almost all basic factors from Dan, though I always felt I learned a lot of things last year when I began to read it.<br /><br />The name of this book is perfect for the content &#8211; Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs. It does not teach about how to program, nor a specific programming language. Of course it is a legacy book. But it seems to me that I cannot get enough from this book unless I have mastered quite a few programming languages. After Dan taught me everything about basic aspects of programming languages and I played with Ruby and Racket for a long time, even after I leaned all those &#8220;nontrivial&#8221; trivial things about C++, when I read it now, I am able to distinguish which part is the essence and which part is written just for the ease of learning, and I can fully focus on how to put different abstractions into different layers&#8211; in other words, learning the structure and interpretation of computer programs.<br /><br />I read a comment, saying that Chapter 4 and 5 are the essence of the book. Hopefully, I can finish reading it before September, and leave enough time for Design Patterns.</div>

P59. I still don&#8217;t think it is necessary to use &#8220;square&#8221; instead of (* x x) everywhere we perform this operation, but I appreciate the idea of &#8220;abstraction&#8221;. It is really a good idea (and practice) to abstract concepts in different levels and use them accordingly.<br /><br />Most of the examples I read are in a top-down design manner: firstly use the abstract concepts, and then implement it in a lower level. The concerns for specific lower-level modules is similar to the way I did using unit test. But I am a little bit confuse how to perform the unit test in this manner. Especially for the closure using in LISP&#8211;implementing local helper functions right after building major function&#8211; how can I make sure the helper functions are right before I run the program as a whole? If I separate a helper function as an independent one, it seems that quite a little redundant work has to perform when I move it back to the major function.<br /><br />Anyway, SICP just makes me love Racket even more =D<br /><br />cheers,</div>

&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Before this accident, I did not even know there were so many places relevant with a single program&#8230; I opened the pandora&#8217;s box beginning with using <code>brew doctor</code> &nbsp;which told me to move directory /usr/local/bin/ prior to /usr/bin/ so that all the homebrewed packages could be found automatically. After I did this, if I executed matplotlib, I would have this runtime error <code>RuntimeError: module compiled against API version 8 but this version of numpy is 6</code>&nbsp;which was somewhat correct by the way. Because I used superpack installed the latest version of numpy(1.8), scipy(0.13), and matplotlib(1.4), but if I printed out the &#8220;numpy.__version__&#8221; in a script, it showed 1.6.1.<br /><br />1) delete all of the outdated versions of numpy<br />2) make sure I explicitly add PYTHONPATH in the bash_profile.<br />3) I even uninstalled and reinstalled the numpy<br />But the problem was still there.<br /><br />After an exhausted search, I found that numpy-1.6.1 in &#8220;/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/Extras/lib/python/&#8221; WTF! I still don&#8217;t know why it search into 2.6 given there is another 2.7 in the same level of directory. Deleting both 2.6 and 2.7 directories (only delete the 2.6 could not work either&#8230;) finally solved the problem. ahooooo&#8230;.<br /><br /></div>

<br />The setup is much harder than I thought&#8230;<br /><br />1) using homebrew installs the emacs and guile. Then, I also need to add path in the .bash_profile to launch the up-to-date emacs rather than the original version 22.1 shipped with the os.<br /><code>export PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/emacs/24.3/bin:$PATH</code><br />2) Enable the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/162896/emacs-on-mac-os-x-leopard-key-bindings">Meta key in terminal</a>, or similar position for iterm2.<br /><br />After these two steps, the following is more&nbsp;straightforward.<br /><br />3) I accidentally found this &#8221;<a href="https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit">emacs-starter-kit</a>&#8221;, which had 2300+ stared and really saved my day. Just follow the instruction and everything will be fine.<br /><br />In current state, I feel emacs kind of like vim+tmux. Anyway, learning new knowledge is always a pleasure, especially about this kind of &#8220;legacy&#8221; stuff.<br /><br /><br />cheers,<br /><br />[UPDATE: after changed the loading sequence of bash in <code>/etc/paths/</code> the first step seems unnecessary&#8230; actually, that was something I should do as soon as I used homebrew to port packages.&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/IUVl9a">http://bit.ly/IUVl9a</a></div>

(<a href="http://www.realworldtech.com/forum/?threadid=104299&amp;curpostid=104196">link</a>)<br /><br />&gt;Care to write an explicit example of a deep problem? (Except memory management - you already mentioned garbage collection.)<br /><br />Concurrency, for example.<br /><br />My point being, that C++ adds absolutely nothing interesting.<br /><br />&gt;All right. Then why do you think C should have support for structures (struct {&#8230;})?<br /><br />That&#8217;s just singularly stupid.<br /><br />C is a good language. It&#8217;s complete enough (and yes, the ability to handle structured data is very much required for any serious language) to be supremely useful, while at the same time being quite simple.<br /><br />A language without structured data types would not be a powerful language the way C is. You do need data structures, and you need pointers (to both data and code) to be at all interesting.<br /><br />But where do you draw the line?<br /><br />I know that you as a C++ proponent you probably won&#8217;t really &#8220;get&#8221; this simple argument, but try:<br /><br />- read the K&amp;R book on C (the ANSI edition), and be enlightened.<br /><br />Notice how the language is basically described by one rather thin book. Readably.<br /><br />So what C does so well is to do that whole &#8220;make it as simple as you can, but no simpler&#8221;. And that is what makes it great. The language is powerful, yet fairly minimal.<br /><br />There really aren&#8217;t many features you could remove from the C language without crippling it. Sure, there&#8217;s<br />three different looping constructs, and you could make trivial (syntactic) changes to the language, but that&#8217;s<br />really not the point. The language is simple, but without being too simple.<br /><br />Now, that&#8217;s not what you always want. I understand very well why people want less system-oriented languages with more built-in functionality. As mentioned, support for both garbage collection and concurrency are quite real problems, and they are both things you can do in C, but that you cannot do well with library interfaces, which is how you normally would extend on C.<br /><br />And garbage collection and concurrency are way more than just syntactic extensions. You can still do them very badly, of course, so it&#8217;s not a trivial path to go down, and I&#8217;m not saying hat a language magically becomes &#8220;good&#8221; just from supporting one or the other.<br /><br />But again: C does what it does very well, and with a clarity of thought and design that is entirely and utterly lacking from C++.<br /><br />And yes, I happen to think that clarity of thought and design is a good thing. It&#8217;s why I liked UNIX, even though I was initially introduced to other things (VMS - ugh).<br /><br />C++ is a mess. There&#8217;s no design. It&#8217;s just &#8220;add crud on top of C&#8221;. And the crud isn&#8217;t even meaningful, much less does it have a design. It&#8217;s totally and utterly random.<br /><br />It started out random, now it&#8217;s randomness that gets added to by a committee.<br /><br />&gt;For example, namespaces and function overloading are *not*<br />&gt;useless. They *do* solve a real problem that C is incapable<br />&gt;of solving.<br /><br />You&#8217;re full of it.<br /><br />&gt;For example, if you want in your source code to define a<br />&gt;function called &#8220;connect&#8221; and you also want include<br />&gt;&#8221;sys/socket.h&#8221;, you cannot do that in C.<br /><br />So to prove how it&#8217;s not just a syntactic feature, you start talking about syntax?<br /><br />What drugs are you on?<br /><br />The name overloading is a total syntactic feature. In C, the way you fix your problem is by a totally trivial syntactic change: you call your function &#8220;my_connect()&#8221;.<br /><br />Wow. It&#8217;s like magic. I added three characters, and made your whole reason for the crap that is C++ go away.<br /><br />The thing is, the above is a really good example of why C++ is horrible, and why C is so simple.<br /><br />Yes, the C solution is really simple. It&#8217;s so simple that it looks downright stupid. But it&#8217;s actually so simple that it is smart because quite frankly, it&#8217;s a lot easier to get confused in C++ code, when the same function name means totally different due to overloading.<br /><br />Of course, you&#8217;re not &#8220;supposed&#8221; to overload things in confusing ways, but the thing is, just do what C does: just make your function names unique. It&#8217;s not that hard, and by avoiding the overloading mess, you make it a lot easier to search for (hey look! &#8220;grep -w my_connect&#8221; just works!), and you avoid ambiguity.<br /><br />(Same exact thing goes for your other example: just add a module prefix or have some other trivial naming rules for your functional split-up, and be happy)<br /><br />Linus<br /><div><br /></div></div>

Pure C as opposed to C++. No idea why. Please don&#8217;t talk about portability,<br />&gt;it&#8217;s BS.<br /><br />*YOU* are full of bullshit.<br /><br />C++ is a horrible language. It&#8217;s made more horrible by the fact that a lot of substandard programmers use it, to the point where it&#8217;s much much easier to generate total and utter crap with it. Quite frankly, even if the choice of C were to do *nothing* but keep the C++ programmers out, that in itself would be a huge reason to use C.<br /><br />In other words: the choice of C is the only sane choice. I know Miles Bader jokingly said &#8220;to piss you off&#8221;, but it&#8217;s actually true. I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that any programmer that would prefer the project to be in C++ over C is likely a programmer that I really *would* prefer to piss off, so that he doesn&#8217;t come and screw up any project I&#8217;m involved with.<br /><br />C++ leads to really really bad design choices. You invariably start using the &#8220;nice&#8221; library features of the language like STL and Boost and other total and utter crap, that may &#8220;help&#8221; you program, but causes:<br /><br />&nbsp;- infinite amounts of pain when they don&#8217;t work (and anybody who tells me that STL and especially Boost are stable and portable is just so full &nbsp;of BS that it&#8217;s not even funny)<br /><br />&nbsp;- inefficient abstracted programming models where two years down the road you notice that some abstraction wasn&#8217;t very efficient, but now all your code depends on all the nice object models around it, and you cannot fix it without rewriting your app.<br /><br />In other words, the only way to do good, efficient, and system-level and portable C++ ends up to limit yourself to all the things that are basically available in C. And limiting your project to C means that people don&#8217;t screw that up, and also means that you get a lot of programmers that do actually understand low-level issues and don&#8217;t screw things up with any idiotic &#8220;object model&#8221; crap.<br /><br />So I&#8217;m sorry, but for something like git, where efficiency was a primary objective, the &#8220;advantages&#8221; of C++ is just a huge mistake. The fact that we also piss off people who cannot see that is just a big additional<br />advantage.<br /><br />If you want a VCS that is written in C++, go play with Monotone. Really. They use a &#8220;real database&#8221;. They use &#8220;nice object-oriented libraries&#8221;. They use &#8220;nice C++ abstractions&#8221;. And quite frankly, as a result of all these design decisions that sound so appealing to some CS people, the end result is a horrible and unmaintainable mess.<br /><br />But I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;d like it more than git.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;">   </span>Linus<br /><br />=====<br /><br />Heath Provost (galvanash@hotmail.com) on 6/5/10 wrote:<br />&gt;<br />&gt;As for C++ exceptions - the same thing really applies here.<br />&gt;They are trying to write explicit code.

The Linux kernel actually does its own exception mechanism, exactly because that way we control what is going on (and do it much more targeted to the actual need in question while giving much better performance and avoiding the crazy unwinding issues).<br /><br />And I really do dislike C++. It&#8217;s a really bad language, in my opinion. It tries to solve all the wrong problems, and does not tackle the right ones. The things C++ &#8220;solves&#8221; are trivial things, almost purely syntactic extensions to C rather than fixing some true deep problem.<br /><br />(The C++ objects, templates and function overloading are all just syntactic sugar. And generally bad syntax at that. And C++ actually makes the C type system actively worse.)<br /><br />In non-systems programming, you should almost certainly use a language that offers garbage collection. That will possibly make a real difference in the complexity of your application. The C++ features? Largely useless, and just helps you screw up more.<br /><br />And in systems programming, you&#8217;re simply better off with C. You&#8217;ll have a way easier time using all the existing code and libraries out there (re-using C++ code? Good luck). Fewer headaches, fewer opportunities to mess up the design and pick some unstable template library.<br /><br />So in neither case is C++ likely the right choice.<br /><br />Linus<br /><br /><br /></div>

&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Cpp is like some stubborn old man, who always says &#8220;i have lots of obscure habits, dealing with it&#8221;&#8230;&#8230;<br /><br /><b>Lesson 4:</b> the initialization is different from assignment, as well as their representations respectively. It is better to write the constructor as the form of initialization, named &#8220;initialization list&#8221;, rather than just simply give the variables first assignment.<br /><br />To avoid using objects before they&#8217;re initialized, then, you need to do only three things. First, manually initialize non-member objects of built-in types. Second, use member initialization lists to initialize all parts of an object. Finally, design around the initialization order uncertainty that afflicts non-local static objects defined in separate translation units.<br /><br /><b>Lesson 7</b>: declare destructors virtual in polymorphic base classes. C++ specifies that when a derived class object is deleted through a pointer to a base class with a non-virtual destructor, results are undefined. What typically happens at runtime is that the derived part of the object is never destroyed. Eliminating the problem is simple: give the base class a virtual destructor. Then deleting a derived class object will do exactly what you want. It will destroy the entire object, including all its derived class parts.<br /><br />The purpose of virtual functions is to allow customization of derived class implementations. Any class with virtual functions should almost certainly have a virtual destructor. The implementation of virtual functions requires that objects carry information that can be used at runtime to determine which virtual functions should be invoked on the object. On the other hand, if a class does not contain virtual functions, that often indicates it is not meant to be used as a base class. When a class is not intended to be a base class, making the destructor virtual is usually a bad idea.<br /><br /><b>Lesson 9</b>: Never call virtual functions during construction or destruction. Because during base class construction of a derived class object, the type of the object is that of the base class. Not only do virtual functions resolve to the base class, but the parts of the language using runtime type information (e.g., dynamic_cast (see Item 27) and typeid) treat the object as a base class type.<br /><br />The same reasoning applies during destruction. Once a derived class destructor has run, the object&#8217;s derived class data members assume undefined values, so C++ treats them as if they no longer exist. Upon entry to the base class destructor, the object becomes a base class object, and all parts of C++ treat it that way.<br /><br />Since you can&#8217;t use virtual functions to call down from base classes during construction, you can compensate by having derived classes pass necessary construction information up to base class constructors instead.<br /><br /></div>
