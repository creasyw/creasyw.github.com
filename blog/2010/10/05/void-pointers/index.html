I have a delemna which I can&#8217;t figure out.<br />&gt; This is regarding &#8220;void pointers&#8221; and I confess, I really don&#8217;t<br />&gt; understand them nearly enough to even understand what the problem is.<br /><br />A void pointer is an address of a region of memory (which may or may not<br />be occupied).&nbsp; It is an error to attempt to use a void value in an<br />expression, hence why compilers will often warn you if you dereference a<br />void pointer.<br />(Note to the regulars: I&#8217;m probably not being perfectly accurate here,<br />but I don&#8217;t think c.l.c pedantry is what steve needs)<br />(Note to steve: the correct spelling is dilemma)<br /><br />&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; void * params[5];<br /><br />This creates an array of 5 pointers to void.&nbsp; It does not create an<br />array of &#8220;void&#8221; (as you seem to think).<br />&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; int int_param_values[5] = {1,2,3,4,5};<br /><br />&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; char **str_param_values;<br /><br />&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; str_param_values = malloc(5 * sizeof(char *));<br />&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; str_param_values[0] = malloc(10 * sizeof(char));<br />&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; strcpy(str_param_values[0], &#8220;hello&#8221;);<br /><br />&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; double dbl_param_values[5] = {1.1, 2.2, 3.3};<br /><br />This creates an array of int, an array of char *, and an array of<br />double, and initialises them in various ways.<br />Note two things: firstly, it would probably make more sense for<br />str_param_values to be an array of 5 char *, and allocated on the stack,<br />with<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; char *str_param_values[5];<br />There is no obvious need for it to be on the heap.<br />Secondly, you have not tested the return value of malloc() in either of<br />these calls; I realise this is only example code (incidentally, you will<br />get more informative answers if you post actual code; then we know what<br />you&#8217;re trying to achieve!) but nonetheless it bears pointing out.<br /><br />&gt; I can then assign my data values, to the array,<br />&gt; like so:<br />&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; params[indx] = (void*)int_param_values[ndx];<br /><br />This is casting an int to a void *.&nbsp; This is generally incorrect as an<br />int is not a pointer type.&nbsp; It just so happens that you are, IIRC,<br />allowed to do this by a special provision to allow the use of integer<br />expressions as pointers.&nbsp; In this case this is clearly not what you are<br />doing as, for instance, params[0] is now (void *)1; this is now a<br />pointer to the memory with address 1, which probably isn&#8217;t even mapped<br />in your program&#8217;s address space (if you&#8217;re on a memory managed<br />architecture.&nbsp; On, say, an embedded system you might want to do this).<br /><br />&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; params[indx] = (void*)str_param_values[ndx];<br /><br />This is casting a char * to a void *.&nbsp; This is allowed because both are<br />pointer types.&nbsp; params[indx] now points to the first character of<br />str_param_values[ndx].<br /><br />&gt; These two methods compile just fine and work as expected.<br />&gt; However, this statement will not compile:<br />&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; params[indx] = (void*)dbl_param_values[ndx];<br /><br />This is casting a double to a void *.&nbsp; This is not allowed; a double is<br />not the same size as, nor anything like, a void *.&nbsp; Unlike an int it<br />cannot even reasonably be interpreted as an address; what location in<br />memory would (void *)0.5 point to?&nbsp; It&#8217;s just silly really!<br /><br />&gt; and generates this compiler error:<br /><br />&gt; &#8220;&#8230;cast from &#8216;double&#8217; to &#8216;pointer to void&#8217; is illegal&#8221;<br /><br />Quite right too.<br /><br />&gt; When it&#8217;s all said and done, the idea is to pass the data referred to<br />&gt; in the array as function parameters,<br />&gt; like so:<br /><br />&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; MyFunction(params[0], params[1], etc.);<br /><br />There are two appropriate methods I can think of.&nbsp; One is to use<br />varargs; if the function&#8217;s first argument gives it some way of deducing<br />the types of the remaining arguments, it can do so.&nbsp; This is for<br />instance how the *printf() family of functions work.<br /><br />The other is to use void *, but populate it not with the data themselves<br />but with pointers to them; for instance your doubles would become<br />something like:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; params[indx] = (void *)&amp;dbl_param_values[ndx];<br />where we assign the /address/ of the double to the pointer; we are now<br />casting a double * to a void *, which makes much more sense as both are<br />pointer types.<br /><br />One question I do have: given your function prototype as you have it,<br />where the only arguments are the params[] elements, how does the<br />function know to what the pointers refer (i.e., whether you have used an<br />int, a double, a char *, or whatever).<br />If, of course, it is simply, say, printing their addresses, it need not<br />know; but if it is using their values, it will have to be told, since<br />not only does it not know their true types, it doesn&#8217;t even know their<br />sizes, and a pointer without size information is not much use.<br /><br />Note also that you cannot make an array of void and store the values<br />(ints, doubles etc.) in that, because void has no storage size.<br /><br />Perhaps the real solution to your problems, however, is to use a struct<br />or union.<br /><br />I can&#8217;t really give any more specific advice without some information as<br />to what you&#8217;re trying to achieve.<br /><br />-Edward<br />==========<br /><br />2nd paste:<br /><br />Hey Ed,<br />thanks for your indepth reply.<br />Very helpful.<br /><br />&gt;

the problem is that you weren&#8217;t putting a<br />pointer to the double into the void *, you were trying to put the double<br />itself into the void *.&nbsp; As mentioned elsewhere in the thread, the &#8216;&amp;&#8217;<br />operator is what you&#8217;re looking for.<br /><br />&gt; What I&#8217;m after here, is a &#8220;generic&#8221; mechanism for holding addresses of<br />&gt; mixed variable types.<br />&gt; i.e.: an array of addresses.<br />&gt; Be they of type int, or char, or double, etc.<br /><br />&gt;

compile time.<br /><br />&gt; Research indicated that void pointers was the way to do this.<br /><br />Firstly, I can&#8217;t think of a good reason why you would want to do this.<br />It sounds as though you&#8217;ve come up with some idea for a &#8216;generic<br />mechanism&#8217; without actually having any use cases in mind.<br />Besides, linking against ill-defined interfaces is a bad idea.&nbsp; If<br />you&#8217;re trying to define functionality at runtime, an embedded scripting<br />language is the way to go.<br />But if you /really/ want this, void pointers will do it - but you have<br />to remember that what you assign to the void pointer has to, itself, be<br />a pointer too (hence why your double to void * cast wasn&#8217;t valid).&nbsp; Also<br />remember that if you pass a pointer, the callee can modify the<br />referenced object.&nbsp; This may not be what you want.<br />What it /really/ sounds like is that you want function overloading<br />and/or dynamic types - in other words, you&#8217;re trying to make C more like<br />C++ or Java.&nbsp; From my perspective that seems like a silly thing to do:<br />why would you want C++ in the first place - and if you do, you know<br />where to find it ;)<br /><br /><br />-Edward<br />==========<br /><br />&nbsp;BTW, the <a href="http://dev-null.chu.cam.ac.uk/">website</a> of Edward is worth viewing.</div>
