  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sep. 9th. Tennis Club</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dealing with high-bounce top-spin balls, the feet should keep on the ground if possible. More importantly, the racket should be a little bit more open than the regular ground stroke, so that the response won’t hit the net.</li>
  <li>When I am running back, hit the ball higher.</li>
  <li>On the other hand, keep body momentum moving forward while hitting. If time is sufficient, turn body for both forehand and backhand stroke. This is similar to boxing, where the most powerful shot is generated by the whole body, not only just arms and shoulders.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sep. 10th. Private lesson.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Begin serving from the Ad-side.</li>
  <li>Toss the ball 45 degree towards the net.</li>
  <li>Toss higher.</li>
  <li>Bend knees is not just a gesture, but is for pushing the body upwards.</li>
  <li>Relax the wrist as much as I can.</li>
  <li>For practice, try to put two feet close to each other first, and then combine the movement of right foot from the regular position to the left foot.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sep. 13th. Mini-Match vs. Dylan</p>

<ul>
  <li>When I am trying to save the ball from backhand, the racket should fact “largely” to the other side rather than to the sky. Stay relatively at the same height of the touching point and push it, not chop it.</li>
  <li>After serving, instead of observing whether the bounce is valid, quickly retreat behind the base line.</li>
  <li>If there is no time to go back to the most comfortable hitting zone, just prepare early, relax wrist, and swing the racket after the bouncing point. There is a good chance I could still hit an acceptable return.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sep. 16th. Mini-Match vs. EricT.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It felt so nice that I am almost (or close to) as competent as one of my coaches one year ago. Maybe it was because I could not push him to the fullest extent as what he did to me in the match. But, whatever, I had four games ending with multiple deuces, and I did won one of them. One is always a good start:)</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It was better than I expected:)</p>

<p>The main changes came from a few simple suggestions of my coach: keeping patient in rally; making percentage shoots and reducing unforced errors as many as possible; warming up longer than I used to; and balance myself while serving. That was it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I suppose my working out in gym also pays off. Several months ago, I started to divide the strength training to smaller parts as upper/lower/core body, along with cardio exercise. For each part, there are several different approaches to work out. Specifically for tennis, the back and core muscles are more important than those of chest and shoulder for ground strokes. A little bit exercises for the forearm could improve the penetration of serving a lot. Lower muscles are much much more important than I expected–they could provide more explosive strength, let running faster, and more importantly, protect the knee joints. Besides, pilate and stretch are indispensable parts for every workout. These last-30-minutes cooling down process help the body relax and keep up with everyday’s progress.</p>

<p>Of course, I still have plenty of REALLY weak aspects, such as lousy serving, bad backspin and volley, and getting lost in the mid-court…</p>

<p>Anyway, I am happy to get this level:) and wish myself could be the champion one day.</p>

<p>[UPDATE] 09/03/2014. I just saw the greatest match in this year, Murray vs. Djokovic. There are some interesting facts.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Both of them slided their feet together while hitting the serving, but when I did that way, my upper body would become unstable which in turn makes my serving even worse…</li>
  <li>Percentage shoots are the mainstream responses, and they would more inclined to approach to the net when hitting down the line.</li>
  <li>Both of them use lots of backspin for defense, but their movements seemed to have more “chopping” than I did. And if I did that way, the ball would float very high and sail…</li>
  <li>Drop shots are effective means to explore the depth of the court. Making the opponents running is almost always a good strategy to disrupt the tempo as well as actively draining off the energy.</li>
  <li>Mental toughness is the key to win the match.</li>
</ul>

<p>[UPDATE] 09/09/2014. I won’t sign up for any 3.0 League in this year since I’ve began to play the tournament in the university. It has less challenging mentally, but more physically. The strategic play is still useful, but I would also expect longer rally and have more cadio-/HIIT training correspondingly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are two dimensions for a court. I just kept forgetting it! It is always worthwhile to explore both left/right and mid/back of the court. As an amateur like me, the most struggling part might be forced to constantly adjust the tempo. I should keep pushing in this kind of manner more often.</p>

<p>It is almost always a wiser choice to stick to the “percentage shot” for both forehand and backhand. I had too many unforced errors hitting down the line. However, on the other hand, when I stand in the middle of the court, I should be more comfortable to change the direction. For most of the opponents, they would struggle more in their backhands. So I could try more inside-out.</p>

<p>I have a better volley technique, but am still awful in both timing and positioning. I can serve with more power, and a little bit more consistent. The next step will be taking more control in direction. Besides, I need to prepare earlier/higher and hit with looser wrist for the ground stroke. I also need push the momentum forward when I hit the ball. It’s almost one year since I learned this activity, but I still cannot master its most basic part…</p>

<p>Well, anyhow =D</p>

<p>[UPDATE 20/07/2014: I just had a big victory this afternoon: 6-1 and 6-2, against the guy who used to beat me twice. Although it would never be a big deal for winning or losing an amateur game, I still feel really happy for that. I have more control for percentage shot and decrease unforced errors a lot.</p>

<p>Aiming higher in the net also could push opponent further away from the court, then have a better chance receiving a shallow response, and then move into the court, hit down the line, and move forward more for volley – this is a right sequence from building to ending a point. Deep balls with strong top spin would seldom be a good chance to change the direction. Instead, just hit cross court and try to be as deep as I can, meanwhile aiming bouncing towards the baseline rather than the side line.</p>

<p>Maybe it’s really useful to keep thinking both during the match and afterwards, it makes me evolve stronger; or maybe my exercises of lower body and core muscles finally pay out; or maybe my resting and eating schedule give me more energy to do the movements right; or more possibly, my opponent just had a bad day. Well…</p>

<p>I love this game, both mentally and physically(:  ]</p>

<p>[UPDATE 24/07/2014: Lost a game. However, anyway, the take-way points are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Prepare earlier.</li>
  <li>Be patient. Anyone could make mistakes in any time.</li>
  <li>Be relax when serving.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3 id="tennis-and-exercises">Tennis and Exercises</h3>

<p>Until now, I’ve played three matches in this round of 3.0 league, lost twice (6-3, 6-3; and another was 7-5 for two hours and left unfinished), and won once (6-4, 1-6, 10-5). My improvements are quite obvious, but still not big enough for me to turn previous loses towards the same opponents to landslide victories. To the maximum extent, I would not lose a set 4 points straight, but stuck in “deuce…add-in…deuce..add-out…” loops.</p>

<p>These are some aspects I should pay attention to</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do NOT make decisions before hitting the balls. They should depend on how good my response is, as well as the position and momentum of my opponent.</li>
  <li>During the point building, keep percentage shots as long as I can.</li>
  <li>And DISTINGUISH it from capitalizing.</li>
  <li>Do NOT be afraid of volley, and do NOT rush it.</li>
  <li>For current level, attacking the back-hand side is almost always a good choice.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, I don’t have any blank left for any tech. aspect, but almost everything needs to be further improved: adding more top spin for both forehand and backhand ground stroke, being more consistent of back spin in half-volley, splitting timely and positioning myself more appropriate as approaching to the net, and better serving.</p>

<h3 id="trip">Trip</h3>

<p>It was great to see the awesome grand canyon, as well as the horseshoe bend and the antelope valley, and it sucked as I recalled the trip of yellowstone every minute in every day. I thought I had got over of the devastation after seven months. But this trip just proved that I was wrong in a hard way.</p>

<p>I will not rush myself to the conclusion of “feeling well” again, and will not do another trip in the near future.</p>

<h3 id="programming-and-online-courses">Programming and Online Courses</h3>

<p>“Know how to solve every problem that has been solved.” – Richard Feynman</p>

<p>There are many things that I need to prepare before the graduate and really job-hunting. Actually, there are more things in my mind than I could complete. So I should choose wisely.</p>

<p>Currently, I am enrolled in the course “Principle of Computing” offered by Rice University in Coursera. It’s easy in general, but interesting to re-think those small games mathematically with the “programming” point of view. Besides, I also continue reading SICP and solving the problems in each chapter. I also go on reading books for Haskell, and watching a course about artificial intelligent in edX. Combining with what I have learned in machine learning and algorithm, I should have a better grasp about what to do and how to do in this field of study. On the other hand, I’ve also dropped off several courses for too much overlapping with what I have already known, or for tedious pedagogy and far-fetched implementations.</p>

<p>I have extensively used Emacs for this summer. Sometimes, I even appreciate its methodology more than I do for Vim, though I would still prefer Vim for 90% of occasions. After tried and failed several times to customize it from scratch, I started beginning with Prelude, and then piling other stuff on it. Despite in favor of most its adds-on, I disable the Viper mode. The logic behind is that if I want to use a Vim, I will use the Vim. Before I fully appreciate its advantages and disadvantages, I would like to keep Emacs as it is. Currently, I use Haskell and Racket in it. It does do a better job than Vim for Haskell, and DrRacket for Racket. Besides, I have tried twice of adopting R in current work, but still cannot find a scenario exclusively using it. It’s not really good at modeling (LISP or Haskell), visualization (matplotlib in Python, JavaScript, or Mathematica), computational efficiency (C++, or Haskell), or just for fun (LISP, ML, or Ruby). Given it is THE favorite language of some of my very smart friends, I will give it another try whenever possible.</p>

<h3 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>

<p>Doing some experiments on myself is fun and worthwhile. For example, I have tried several days to go to bed earlier than I usually do. My feeling is more or less the same as what said in <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/06/27/sleep-as-a-competitive-advantage/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=1&amp;">“Sleep as a Competitive Advantage”</a>, and I will stick to it.</p>

<p>Because I need to toss the tennis ball better, I use my left hand as often as I can, such as drawing diagrams or doing all kinds of doodle/calculations. It’s too soon to tell if I have any progress. I am also trying different ways to brew coffee. Pour-over versus press pot seems like another version of Emacs versus Vim.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><ul>
  <li>The ability to visualize the consequences of the actions under consideration is crucial to becoming an expert programmer.</li>
  <li>Procedures that manipulate procedures, including accept them as arguments or return them as values, are called <em>higher-order procedures</em>. (The <em>sigma</em> summation and the derivative operation are all good/simple examples for the latter case.) This is one of the basic characteristics of <em>factional programming languages</em>.</li>
  <li>The significance of higher-order procedures is that they enable us to represent these abstractions explicitly as elements in our programming language, so that they can be handled just like other computational elements……As programmers, we should be alert to opportunities to identify the underlying abstractions in our programs and to build upon them and generalize them to create more powerful abstractions……It poses challenges for efficient implementation, but the resulting gain in expressive power is enormous.</li>
  <li>As with compound procedures, the main issue is to be addressed is that of abstraction as a technique for coping with complexity, while the data abstraction enables us to erect suitable <em>abstraction barriers</em> between different parts of a program.</li>
  <li>In general, the underlying idea of data abstraction is to identify for each type of data object a basic set of operations in terms of which all manipulations of data objects of that type will be expressed, and then to use only those operations in manipulating the data.</li>
  <li>The approach of <em>stratified design</em> is the notion that a complex system should be structured as a sequence of levels that are described using a sequence of languages. Each level is constructed by combining parts that are regarded as primitive at that level, and the parts constructed at each level are used as primitives at the next level. The language used at each level of a stratified design has primitives, means of combinations, and means of abstraction appropriate to that level of detail.</li>
  <li>(Thoughts) I thought local binding with “let/let*/letrec” are similar to what I did in the imperative programming in a sense that I was telling the program what to do. However, this is not the essence. The local binding is the part of paper which contains the “where…” after a complicated formula. It is the way for data abstract.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><ul>
  <li>Ideally, every time hitting the ball should be a “kinetic chain of reactions”– the momentum moves from feet to knee, to waist, to shoulder, and finally to the forearm and wrist.</li>
  <li>If I only use part of the chain, I might still hit a good ball, occasionally. But it would consume more energy, and the hitting would be much more unstable.</li>
  <li>Technically speaking, serve is the only way that I can completely control this kinetic chain, because I can control all of the paces and do not need to move around.</li>
  <li>During a point, whenever opponent hits the ball, I should pause and split feet, no matter where I am in the court. This could help me make judgment. More importantly, it is the way to “load energy” and start the “kinetic chain”.</li>
  <li>I have too many aspects to improve, but this might be the most important one.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last Thursday, I had another win in the league(: In my point of view, I was pretty lucky for the previous victories, but I did have an overwhelming victory this time. I was much better than one month ago (yeah! of course=P), and the opponent was a sub-player, who was weaker than others in the league. Although he had a strong surfing, both his forehand and backhand were not so good. The responses were soft and shallow with only a little bit back spin, which gave me a wide angel to hit either inside-in or inside-out.</p>

<p>When I talked with my coach yesterday, he provided some valuable insights about how I should consider the process of a match</p>

<ul>
  <li>Keep the feet floating while preparing ground stroke.</li>
  <li><strong>Volley is the only way to end a point</strong>. No matter how aggressive the ground strokes are, they are not considered to end the point. Instead, they just <em>build</em> the point. If it ends, let it be. If not, that’s the normal case. It means I should always prepare for the next stroke. And the sad part of the story is that after nine months I still don’t really know how to end a point……</li>
  <li>Do not get frustrated playing with players who consistently send lofty backspin. If he voluntarily hands over the control of pace, I should use it wisely: add more topspin on the returns; actively change the angel; don’t rush to end the point but patiently build it.</li>
  <li>Prepare earlier: decide to use forehand or backhand based on the trajectory; once decided, prepare for the ready position; after the bounce, I should begin the movement of hitting; the center of gravity should put into the front halves of the feet, and always keep the momentum forward while hitting the ball.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am glad that I could survive on three-hours sleep per day for almost two weeks. Of course, there were quite a few downsides: I felt very weak after the first several days, and the feeling lasted till the end; I lost 1 and dropped the other 2 times of tennis matches in this period; my Github longest streak of contribution stopped at 200 days, which is the date right before my comprehensive defense…</p>

<p>The things that I completed in return include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A 96-pages thesis for the comprehensive defense</li>
  <li>A collection of decent slides built by Beamer/Latex for defense</li>
  <li>Passed it =D</li>
  <li>A part of one NSF proposal</li>
  <li>One research paper submitted to Globecom’14</li>
  <li>Mid-term II of Game Theory</li>
  <li>One reviewing paper from EuraSip</li>
  <li>The least amount of homework and projects in Coursera that keep me within the schedule</li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, there are lots of lessons to take away from this process. Concerning the defense about research, I find myself still need to adjust the strategy handling problems. In research, it is not about getting thing done, but about how to propose the right question (relevant with the basic/advanced theorems of the related fields) and to make at least some sense out of it.</p>

<p>For the research, I should not pile up most of the work to the last week of the due date, especially when I could anticipate this busy schedule months before. In Jan. and Feb., I did waste plenty of time to try out different algorithms handling the problem, but none of them had the “sky-high” performances, so I just kept trying. Eventually, when the time run out, I chose the “sub-optimal” solution and wrote the paper in a hurry. This should not be the right way. Sometimes, when the theoretical merits are fascinating, I might need to only derive the theorems and formulas with some naive simulations. When the trial and error process has to perform, I should set a “early termination” threshold and record every “best effort” in different scenarios. It will help me leisurely handle the due date, and maybe produce more work/papers.</p>

<p>I hope I won’t have this kind of busy schedule again, in the sense that I have a better planning and complete each work as soon as I can.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It is worth noting that yesterday I had my first win in the 3.0 league=D 7-5, 3-6, and 10-6 in the tie-breaker set. In today’s lesson, Bob told me a bit more about strategic playing. It was all about probing different aspects of the opponent.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Keep hitting in the middle (or either left or right) as long as I can, and see what is the tolerance of the opponent – whether him or me would get frustrated first and try to make some change.</li>
  <li>Consistently push either his backhand or forehand within a point.</li>
  <li>Driving the ball from side to side and observe the pattern of his transition – does he have a high successful rate for the ground stroke while moving? Is his forehand-to-backhand better or worse than the backhand-to-forehand? Does he tend to hit cross court or staight down to the line?</li>
</ul>

<p>The advanced version will also include the timing of pushing towards the net as well as volley, but I haven’t got there yet… I am still struggling to position myself in the transition of volley, let alone the judgement of lobbing or cut-across from my opponent… So, there is a long way to go(:</p>

<p>[Update March 7] The control of my ground stroke is nice, but the hitting point is far from optimal – I should keep the racquet a little bit “closer” and the hitting point should be a little bit in front while the racquet rising in its maximum speed and facing towards the net. Still, The target zone is “higher in the net”.</p>

<p>[Update March 15] The way to increase spin is to make the preparison faster and to prepare the racquet a little bit lower–all movements should be done before the bonuce.</p>
