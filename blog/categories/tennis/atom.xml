    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sep. 9th. Tennis Club</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dealing with high-bounce top-spin balls, the feet should keep on the ground if possible. More importantly, the racket should be a little bit more open than the regular ground stroke, so that the response won’t hit the net.</li>
  <li>When I am running back, hit the ball higher.</li>
  <li>On the other hand, keep body momentum moving forward while hitting. If time is sufficient, turn body for both forehand and backhand stroke. This is similar to boxing, where the most powerful shot is generated by the whole body, not only just arms and shoulders.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sep. 10th. Private lesson.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Begin serving from the Ad-side.</li>
  <li>Toss the ball 45 degree towards the net.</li>
  <li>Toss higher.</li>
  <li>Bend knees is not just a gesture, but is for pushing the body upwards.</li>
  <li>Relax the wrist as much as I can.</li>
  <li>For practice, try to put two feet close to each other first, and then combine the movement of right foot from the regular position to the left foot.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sep. 13th. Mini-Match vs. Dylan</p>

<ul>
  <li>When I am trying to save the ball from backhand, the racket should fact “largely” to the other side rather than to the sky. Stay relatively at the same height of the touching point and push it, not chop it.</li>
  <li>After serving, instead of observing whether the bounce is valid, quickly retreat behind the base line.</li>
  <li>If there is no time to go back to the most comfortable hitting zone, just prepare early, relax wrist, and swing the racket after the bouncing point. There is a good chance I could still hit an acceptable return.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sep. 16th. Mini-Match vs. Eric.T.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It felt so nice that I am almost (or close to) as competent as one of the coaching staff one year ago in the very beginner class. Maybe it was because I could not push him to the fullest extent as what he did to me in the match. But, whatever, I had four games ending with multiple deuces, and I did won one of them. One is always a good start:)</li>
  <li>He cared less about the “percentage shoot” than what I did, but he would observe my movements and always tried to hit the open court. This would be my goal in (hopefully) three months.</li>
  <li>My serving is relatively stable now. I need to relax more, both physically and mentally, for both shoulder and wrist; to catch the ball a little bit higher; and to push it more upwards and forwards. Plus right direction of tossing and more practice, I could at least stop bleeding in my serving games.</li>
  <li>There are too many pieces missing from my repository. I am thinking to master back spin as the next step–for defense as well as changing the tempo of the match. After that, I will revisit ground stroke, transition from back court to mid-court, volley/over-head, and then serving again. All of them might take another month and a half. After that, I will seek a re-match with Eric and see how will that go.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sep. 18th. Private lesson and Drill</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learned how to do the backhand back spin:
    <ul>
      <li>To prepare, I should REALLY turn the body sideways. Use the left hand help to hold the racket.</li>
      <li>Prepare the racket a little bit higher. The slightly downwards movement will help to prevent the response floating much.</li>
      <li>The length of swing is longer than what I am used to for the double-handed backhand. So, swing early.</li>
      <li>The contact point is farther away from the body, so I should not over run or need to leave enough room for the swing.</li>
      <li>Relax the shoulder but not turn the waist too much. Meanwhile, lean body towards the net. That is, the majority of the force should be forward rather than to the right side.</li>
      <li>The face of racket should also face mainly towards the net.</li>
      <li>If possible, follow through the racket to the right side to give the ball more side spin.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When I did the volley, I should never jump at the same time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sep. 21th. Match with Reazul.H. (5-6, 7-6)</p>

<ul>
  <li>I’ve lost to this guy three times in a row in the league. So, I am really glad that today’s result could demonstrate my progress.</li>
  <li>His strategy puts defense in the 1st priority, waiting for me to earn the point or to make an unforced error. I have the controlled strokes for the most of the match. That’s great.</li>
  <li>When I can put the 1st serve in, the serving game becomes really easy to keep. In the 2nd set, maybe because of the tired, I have to breath really hard and to exhale out loud while serving. It actually helps me to keep the rhythm right. Of course, other points also hold: relax wrist, toss 45 degree in front of the body, toss high, bend knees and lift the whole body up, touch the ball in the highest point and push it upwards and forwards.</li>
  <li>I have several good drop shots and overhead hits, but those are not consistent. I need to work on it more. Exploring the 2D of the court is always worth trying–for consuming the opponent’s energy and disrupting his typo.</li>
  <li>Back spin by backhand does not work for most of the time…</li>
  <li>I should not retreat way back in the court unless the opponent has really good and strong top spin. Pushing forward is beneficial to enlarge the hitting angle and to put pressure to the other side. This is actually the only way to end a point. However, to achieve it, I need to prepare much earlier and turn sideways to add spin, and do the volley right–follow the route of the return, pause and split before the opponent hits the ball, keep both feet on the ground, and push the ball to the OPEN COURT!</li>
</ul>

    <id>http://creasyw.github.io/blog/2014/08/30/third-season-of-3-dot-0-ends-up-with-2nd-place</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It was better than I expected:)</p>

<p>The main changes came from a few simple suggestions of my coach: keeping patient in rally; making percentage shoots and reducing unforced errors as many as possible; warming up longer than I used to; and balance myself while serving. That was it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I suppose my working out in gym also pays off. Several months ago, I started to divide the strength training to smaller parts as upper/lower/core body, along with cardio exercise. For each part, there are several different approaches to work out. Specifically for tennis, the back and core muscles are more important than those of chest and shoulder for ground strokes. A little bit exercises for the forearm could improve the penetration of serving a lot. Lower muscles are much much more important than I expected–they could provide more explosive strength, let running faster, and more importantly, protect the knee joints. Besides, pilate and stretch are indispensable parts for every workout. These last-30-minutes cooling down process help the body relax and keep up with everyday’s progress.</p>

<p>Of course, I still have plenty of REALLY weak aspects, such as lousy serving, bad backspin and volley, and getting lost in the mid-court…</p>

<p>Anyway, I am happy to get this level:) and wish myself could be the champion one day.</p>

<p>[UPDATE] 09/03/2014. I just saw the greatest match in this year, Murray vs. Djokovic. There are some interesting facts.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Both of them slided their feet together while hitting the serving, but when I did that way, my upper body would become unstable which in turn makes my serving even worse…</li>
  <li>Percentage shoots are the mainstream responses, and they would more inclined to approach to the net when hitting down the line.</li>
  <li>Both of them use lots of backspin for defense, but their movements seemed to have more “chopping” than I did. And if I did that way, the ball would float very high and sail…</li>
  <li>Drop shots are effective means to explore the depth of the court. Making the opponents running is almost always a good strategy to disrupt the tempo as well as actively draining off the energy.</li>
  <li>Mental toughness is the key to win the match.</li>
</ul>

<p>[UPDATE] 09/09/2014. I won’t sign up for any 3.0 League in this year since I’ve began to play the tournament in the university. It has less challenging mentally, but more physically. The strategic play is still useful, but I would also expect longer rally and have more cadio-/HIIT training correspondingly.</p>

    <link href="http://creasyw.github.io/blog/2014/07/17/3-dot-0-league-for-the-third-time/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-17T10:47:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://creasyw.github.io/blog/2014/07/17/3-dot-0-league-for-the-third-time</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are two dimensions for a court. I just kept forgetting it! It is always worthwhile to explore both left/right and mid/back of the court. As an amateur like me, the most struggling part might be forced to constantly adjust the tempo. I should keep pushing in this kind of manner more often.</p>

<p>It is almost always a wiser choice to stick to the “percentage shot” for both forehand and backhand. I had too many unforced errors hitting down the line. However, on the other hand, when I stand in the middle of the court, I should be more comfortable to change the direction. For most of the opponents, they would struggle more in their backhands. So I could try more inside-out.</p>

<p>I have a better volley technique, but am still awful in both timing and positioning. I can serve with more power, and a little bit more consistent. The next step will be taking more control in direction. Besides, I need to prepare earlier/higher and hit with looser wrist for the ground stroke. I also need push the momentum forward when I hit the ball. It’s almost one year since I learned this activity, but I still cannot master its most basic part…</p>

<p>Well, anyhow =D</p>

<p>[UPDATE 20/07/2014: I just had a big victory this afternoon: 6-1 and 6-2, against the guy who used to beat me twice. Although it would never be a big deal for winning or losing an amateur game, I still feel really happy for that. I have more control for percentage shot and decrease unforced errors a lot.</p>

<p>Aiming higher in the net also could push opponent further away from the court, then have a better chance receiving a shallow response, and then move into the court, hit down the line, and move forward more for volley – this is a right sequence from building to ending a point. Deep balls with strong top spin would seldom be a good chance to change the direction. Instead, just hit cross court and try to be as deep as I can, meanwhile aiming bouncing towards the baseline rather than the side line.</p>

<p>Maybe it’s really useful to keep thinking both during the match and afterwards, it makes me evolve stronger; or maybe my exercises of lower body and core muscles finally pay out; or maybe my resting and eating schedule give me more energy to do the movements right; or more possibly, my opponent just had a bad day. Well…</p>

<p>I love this game, both mentally and physically(:  ]</p>

<p>[UPDATE 24/07/2014: Lost a game. However, anyway, the take-way points are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Prepare earlier.</li>
  <li>Be patient. Anyone could make mistakes in any time.</li>
  <li>Be relax when serving.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<ul>
  <li>Ideally, every time hitting the ball should be a “kinetic chain of reactions”– the momentum moves from feet to knee, to waist, to shoulder, and finally to the forearm and wrist.</li>
  <li>If I only use part of the chain, I might still hit a good ball, occasionally. But it would consume more energy, and the hitting would be much more unstable.</li>
  <li>Technically speaking, serve is the only way that I can completely control this kinetic chain, because I can control all of the paces and do not need to move around.</li>
  <li>During a point, whenever opponent hits the ball, I should pause and split feet, no matter where I am in the court. This could help me make judgment. More importantly, it is the way to “load energy” and start the “kinetic chain”.</li>
  <li>I have too many aspects to improve, but this might be the most important one.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last Thursday, I had another win in the league(: In my point of view, I was pretty lucky for the previous victories, but I did have an overwhelming victory this time. I was much better than one month ago (yeah! of course=P), and the opponent was a sub-player, who was weaker than others in the league. Although he had a strong surfing, both his forehand and backhand were not so good. The responses were soft and shallow with only a little bit back spin, which gave me a wide angel to hit either inside-in or inside-out.</p>

<p>When I talked with my coach yesterday, he provided some valuable insights about how I should consider the process of a match</p>

<ul>
  <li>Keep the feet floating while preparing ground stroke.</li>
  <li><strong>Volley is the only way to end a point</strong>. No matter how aggressive the ground strokes are, they are not considered to end the point. Instead, they just <em>build</em> the point. If it ends, let it be. If not, that’s the normal case. It means I should always prepare for the next stroke. And the sad part of the story is that after nine months I still don’t really know how to end a point……</li>
  <li>Do not get frustrated playing with players who consistently send lofty backspin. If he voluntarily hands over the control of pace, I should use it wisely: add more topspin on the returns; actively change the angel; don’t rush to end the point but patiently build it.</li>
  <li>Prepare earlier: decide to use forehand or backhand based on the trajectory; once decided, prepare for the ready position; after the bounce, I should begin the movement of hitting; the center of gravity should put into the front halves of the feet, and always keep the momentum forward while hitting the ball.</li>
</ul>
