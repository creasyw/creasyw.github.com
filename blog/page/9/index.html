<ol><li><strong>Set a duration of how long you think it should take to solve a problem - </strong>C&#8217;mon, admit it! I&#8217;m just as guilty as the next programmer. I&#8217;ve seen programmers sit in front of a monitor for eight hours at a time trying to solve a particular problem. Set a time table for yourself of 1 hour, 30 minutes, or even 15 minutes. If you can&#8217;t figure out a solution to your problem within your time frame, ask for help or research your problem on the Internet instead of trying to be super-coder.</li><li><strong>A language is a language is a language</strong> - Over time, once you understand how one language works, you&#8217;ll notice similarities between other languages. The language you choose should provide you with a suitable &#8220;comfort&#8221; level, the ability to produce efficient (and clean) code, and, above all, allow the language to suit the project and vice-versa.</li><li><strong>Don&#8217;t over-&#8220;design pattern&#8221; applications</strong> - Sometimes it&#8217;s just easier to write a simple algorithm than it is to incorporate a singleton or facade pattern. For the most part, it even allows for cleaner, understandable code. :-)</li><li><strong>Always backup your code</strong> - I&#8217;ve experienced a complete hard drive failue and lost a lot of code when I was younger and felt horrible because of what had happened. The one time you don&#8217;t back up your data may be the one time where you have a strict deadline with a client and they need it tomorrow. Source code/version control applies here as well.<br /></li><li><strong>You are not the best at programming. Live with it.</strong> - I always thought that I knew so much about programming, but there is always someone out there better than you. Always. Learn from them.</li><li><strong>Learn to learn more</strong> - With number five explained, I&#8217;ve always had a magazine or book in my hand about computers or programming (ask my friends, they&#8217;ll confirm). True, there is a lot of technology out there and keeping up with it is a fulltime job, but if you have a smart way of receiving your news, you&#8217;ll learn about new technology every single day.</li><li><strong>Change is constant</strong> - Your knowledge of technology and/or programming should be similar to how you treat stocks: Diversify. Don&#8217;t get too comfortable with a particular technology. If there&#8217;s not enough support for that language or technology, you might as well start updating your resume now and start your training period. My general rule of thumb that has kept me going? Know at least two or three languages, so if one dies off, you have another one to fall back on while you train for a new technology.</li><li><strong>Support Junior</strong> - Assist and train the junior/entry-level developers on good programming guidelines and techniques. You never know&#8230;you may move up in rank and you&#8217;ll feel more confident having personally trained and prepared them for their next position.</li><li><strong>Simplify the algorithm</strong> - Code like a fiend, but once you&#8217;re done, go back through your code and optimize it. A little code improvement here and there will make support happier in the long run.</li><li><strong>Document your code</strong> - Whether its documenting a Web Service API or documenting a simple class, document as you go. I&#8217;ve been accused of over-commenting my code and that&#8217;s something I&#8217;m proud of. It only takes a second to add an additional comment line for each 3 lines of code. If it&#8217;s a harder technique to grasp, don&#8217;t be afraid to over-comment. This is one problem most architects, backup coders, and support groups don&#8217;t complain about if you&#8217;ve done your job right.</li><li><strong>Test, Test, Test</strong> - I&#8217;m a fan of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box_testing">Black Box Testing</a>. When your routine is finished, your &#8220;stamp of approval&#8221; period starts. If you have a Quality Assurance department, you may be talking more to them than your project manager regarding errors in your code. If you don&#8217;t test your code thoroughly, you may develop more than code. Possibly a bad reputation.</li><li><strong>Celebrate every success</strong> - I&#8217;ve met a lot of programmers who have conquered headache-style problems with a great programming technique and celebrated with a fellow programmer by doing the &#8220;shake&#8221;, the high-five, or even a &#8220;happy dance.&#8221; Everyone has enlightening periods in their life and even though that one happy coder asked you to come and see his extraordinary piece of code and you&#8217;ve seen that one piece of code over 100 times in your experiences, celebrate the success of a fellow developer for the 101-st time.</li><li><strong>Have Code Reviews Frequently</strong> - On projects and personally. In the company, you will always have code reviews of how well you coded something. Don&#8217;t look at it as people crucifying your coding style. Think of it as constructive criticism. On the personal front, review your code and always ask, &#8220;How could I have done it better?&#8221; This will accelerate your learning and make you a better programmer.</li><li><strong>R</strong><strong>eminisce about your code</strong> - There are two ways to looking at old code: &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe I wrote this code&#8221; and &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe I wrote this code.&#8221; The first statement is often of disgust and wondering how you can improve it. You&#8217;d be surprised at how old code can be resurrected into a possible and better routine, or maybe even an entire product. The second statement is of amazement and achievement. Developers have their one or two project code achievements that they completed and had everyone standing up and taking notice. Again, based on your excellent coding ability, you could take those past routines or projects and update them into a better product or idea.</li><li><strong>Humor is necessary</strong> - In my 20 years of development, I have never met a programmer who hasn&#8217;t had a decent sense of humor. Actually, in this industry, it&#8217;s a requirement.</li><li><strong>Beware the know-it-all, <a href="http://www.dcs-media.com/Archive/business-lesson-1-7G">possessive coder</a>, and the inexperienced coder</strong> - Humble yourself when you meet these types of coders. The know-it-all tries to upstage you instead of working as a team player, the defensive coder created code that he doesn&#8217;t want to share with anyone, and the inexperienced coder constantly asks for assistance every ten minutes where the finished code developed is yours, not theirs.</li><li><strong>No project is ever simple</strong> - I&#8217;ve been asked by friends, family, and associates to just &#8220;whip something up for me.&#8221; To &#8220;whip&#8221; up a program or web site, it takes planning from both parties to complete something that both sides can appreciate. If someone needs a 3-page web site with Microsoft Access from the start, it winds up becoming a 15-page web site with SQL Server, a forum, and a custom CMS (Content Management System).</li><li><strong>Never take anything for granted</strong> - If you take on a simple project, you may think that a certain section will be easy to complete. Don&#8217;t think that even for a moment. Unless you have a class, component, or piece of code<em> already coded</em>&#8230;and has been tested thoroughly&#8230;and is in production from an existing project, don&#8217;t think it will be easy.</li><li><strong>Software is never finished</strong> - A fellow programmer once told me that software is never finished, it&#8217;s &#8220;temporarily completed.&#8221; Sound advice. If the client is still using a program you wrote and has stood the test of time, chances are, you are still updating it, which isn&#8217;t a bad thing. It keeps you working. :-)</li><li><strong>Patience is definitely a virtue</strong> - When clients, friends, or family members use a PC, they get frustrated and proceed to hit a component of the PC or storm off. I keep telling everyone, &#8220;you are controlling the computer not the other way around.&#8221; You need to have a certain level of patience for programming computers. As soon as programmers understand what they did wrong, they look at it from the computers point of view and say, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s why it was doing that.&#8221;</li></ol></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
After decades of programming I do not even think about these three ways to read code. I just glance at it and know what it means, and I can even glance at a whole screen of code, and all the bugs and errors jump out at me. That took an incredibly long time and quite a bit more study than is sane. To get that way, I learned these three ways of reading most any programming language:<br /><br />1. Front to back.<br />2. Back to front.<br />3. Counter-clock-wise.<br /><br />Try them out when you have a difficult statement to figure out. When you type the next block of your code, go over it in these ways. This one is gonna be fun.<br /><br />&#8230;&#8230;<br /><br />I am warning you, this will be frustrating. In the business we call this &#8220;yak shaving&#8221;. Yak shaving is any activity that is mind numblingly irritatingly boring and tedious that you have to do before you can do something else that&#8217;s more fun. You want to create cool Python projects, but you can&#8217;t do that until you setup a skeleton directory, but you can&#8217;t setup a skeleton directory until you install some packages, but you can&#8217;t install pacakages until you install package installers, and you can&#8217;t install package installers until you figure out how your system installs software in general, and so on.<br /><br />Struggle through this anyway. Consider it your trial-by-annoyance to get into the programmer club. Every programmer has to do these annoying tedious tasks before they can do something cool.<br /><br />&#8230;&#8230;<br /><br />What I discovered after this journey of learning is that the languages did not matter, it&#8217;s what you do with them. Actually, I always knew that, but I&#8217;d get distracted by the languages and forget it periodically. Now I never forget it,<br />and neither should you.<br /><br />Which programming language you learn and use does not matter. Do not get sucked into the religion surrounding programing languages as that will only blind you to their true purpose of being your tool for doing interesting things.<br /><br />Programming as an intellectual activity is the only art form that allows you to create interactive art. You can create projects that other people can play with, and you can talk to them indirectly. No other art form is quite this &nbsp;interactive. Movies flow to the audience in one direction. Paintings do not move. Code goes both ways.<br /><br />Programming as a profession is only moderately interesting. It can be a good job, but if you want to make about the same money and be happier, you could actually just go run a fast food joint. You are much better off using code as<br />your secret weapon in another profession.<br /><br />People who can code in the world of technology companies are a dime a dozen and get no respect. People who can code in biology, medicine, government, sociology, physics, history, and mathematics are respected and can do amazing things to advance those disciplines.<br /><br />Of course, all of this advice is pointless. If you liked learning to write software with this book, you should try to use it to improve your life any way you can. Go out and explore this weird wonderful new intellectual pursuit that barely anyone in the last 50 years has been able to explore. Might as well enjoy it while you can.<br /><br />Finally, I will say that learning to create software changes you and makes you different. Not better or worse, just different. You may find that people treat you harshly because you can create software, maybe using words like &#8220;nerd&#8221;. Maybe you will find that because you can dissect their logic that they hate arguing with you. You may even find that simply knowing how a computer works makes you annoying and weird to them.<br /><br />To this I have one just piece of advice: they can go to hell. The world needs more weird people who know how things work and who love to figure it all out. When they treat you like this, just remember that this is your journey, not theirs. Being different is not a crime, and people who tell you it is are just jealous that you have picked up a skill they never in their wildest dreams could acquire.<br /><br />You can code. They cannot. That is pretty damn cool.<br />===<br /><br />***CLASS STYLE<br />* Your class should use “camel case” like SuperGoldFactory rather than super_gold_factory.<br />* Try not to do too much in your __init__ functions. It makes them harder to use.<br />* Your other functions should use “underscore format” so write my_awesome_hair and not myawesomehair or MyAwesomeHair.<br />* Be consistent in how you organize your function arguments. If your class has to deal with users, dogs, and cats, keep that order throughout unless it really doesn&#8217;t make sense. If you have one function takes (dog, cat, user) and the other takes (user, cat, dog), it&#8217;ll be hard to use.<br />* Try not to use variables that come from the module or globals. They should be fairly self-contained.<br />* A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. Consistency is good, but foolishly following some idiotic mantra because everyone else does is bad style. Think for yourself.<br />* Always, always have class Name(object) format or else you will be in big trouble.<br /><br />***CODE STYLE<br />* Give your code vertical space so people can read it. You will find some very bad programmers who are able to write reasonable code, but who do not add any spaces. This is bad style in any language because the human eye and brain use space and vertical alignment to scan and separate visual elements. Not having space is the same as giving your code an awesome camouflage paint job.<br />* If you can&#8217;t read it out loud, it&#8217;s probably hard to read. If you are having a problem making something easy to use, try reading it out loud. Not only does this force you to slow down and really read it, but it also helps you find difficult passages and things to change for readability.<br />* Try to do what other people are doing in Python until you find your own style.<br />* Once you find your own style, do not be a jerk about it. Working with other people&#8217;s code is part of being a programmer, and other people have really bad taste. Trust me, you will probably have really bad taste too and not even realize it.<br />* If you find someone who writes code in a style you like, try writing something that mimics their style.<br /><br />***GOOD COMMENTS<br />* There are programmers who will tell you that your code should be readable enough that you do not need comments. They&#8217;ll then tell you in their most official sounding voice that, &#8220;Ergo you should never write comments.&#8221; Those programmers are either consultants who get paid more if other people can&#8217;t use their code, or incompetents who tend to never work with other people. Ignore them and write comments.<br />* When you write comments, describe why you are doing what you are doing. The code already says how, but why you did things the way you did is more important.<br />* When you write doc comments for your functions , make the comments documentation for someone who will have to use your code. You do not have to go crazy, but a nice little sentence about what someone does with that function helps a lot.<br />* Finally, while comments are good, too many are bad, and you have to maintain them. Keep your comments relatively short and to the point, and if you change a function, review the comment to make sure it&#8217;s still correct.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
13 June 1996 New York<br />Dear Borges,<br /><br />Since your literature was always placed under the sign of eternity, it doesn&#8217;t seem too odd to be addressing a letter to you. (Borges, it&#8217;s 10 years!) If ever a contemporary seemed destined for literary immortality, it was you. You were very much the product of your time, your culture, and yet you knew how to transcend your time, your culture, in ways that seem quite magical. This had something to do with the openness and generosity of your attention. You were the least egocentric, the most transparent of writers, as well as the most artful. It also had something to do with a natural purity of spirit. Though you lived among us for a rather long time, you perfected practices of fastidiousness and of detachment that made you an expert mental traveller to other eras as well. You had a sense of time that was different from other people&#8217;s. The ordinary ideas of past, present and future seemed banal under your gaze. You liked to say that every moment of time contains the past and the future, quoting (as I&nbsp; remember) the poet Browning, who wrote something like, &#8220;the present is the instant in which the future crumbles into the past.&#8221; That, of course, was part of your modesty: your taste for finding your ideas in the ideas of other writers.<br /><br />Your modesty was part of the sureness of your presence. You were a discoverer of new joys. A pessimism as profound, as serene, as yours did not need to be indignant. It had, rather, to be inventive – and you were, above all, inventive. The serenity and the transcendence of self that you found are to me exemplary. You showed that it is not necessary to be unhappy, even while one is clear-eyed and undeluded about how terrible everything is. Somewhere you said that a writer–delicately you added: all persons – must think that whatever happens to him or her is a resource. (You were speaking of your blindness.) You have been a great resource, for other writers. In 1982 – that is, four years before you died – I said in an interview, &#8220;There is no writer living today who matters more to other writers than Borges. Many people would say he is the greatest living writer&#8230; Very few writers of today have not learnt from him or imitated him.&#8221;<br /><br />That is still true. We are still learning from you. We are still imitating you. You gave people new ways of imagining, while proclaiming over and over our indebtedness to the past, above all, to literature. You said that we owe literature almost everything we are and what we have been. If books disappear, history will disappear, and human beings will also disappear. I am sure you are right. Books are not only the arbitrary sum of our dreams, and our memory. They also give us the model of self-transcendence. Some people think of reading only as a kind of escape: an escape from the &#8220;real&#8221; everyday world to an imaginary world, the world of books. Books are much more. They are a way of being fully human.<br /><br />I&#8217;m sorry to have to tell you that books are now considered an endangered species. By books, I also mean the conditions of reading that make possible literature and its soul effects. Soon, we are told, we will call up on &#8220;bookscreens&#8221; any &#8220;text&#8221; on demand, and will be able to change its appearance, ask questions of it, &#8220;interact&#8221; with it. When books become &#8220;texts&#8221; that we &#8220;interact&#8221; with according to criteria of utility, the written word will have become simply another aspect of our advertising-driven televisual reality. This is the glorious future being created, and promised to us, as something more &#8220;democratic&#8221;. Of course, it means nothing less then the death of inwardness – and of the book.<br /><br />This time around, there will be no need for a great conflagration. The barbarians don&#8217;t have to burn the books. The tiger is in the library. Dear Borges, please understand that it gives me no satisfaction to complain. But to whom could such complaints about the fate of books–of reading itself – be better addressed than to you? (Borges, it&#8217;s 10 years!) All I mean to say is that we miss you. I miss you. You continue to make a difference. The era we are entering now, this 21st century, will test the soul in new ways. But, you can be sure, some of us are not going to abandon the Great Library. And you will continue to be our patron and our hero.<br /><br />Extracted from &#8216;Where the Stress Falls&#8217; by Susan Sontag (Jonathan Cape, £17.99).</div>
